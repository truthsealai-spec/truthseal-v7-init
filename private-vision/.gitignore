# TruthSeal™ AEGIS — Hardware-Enforced Governance for High-Impact AI

**November 20, 2025 – Public Proposal**

Goal: No high-impact AI action (trade, grid switch, robot motion) may execute without proving coherence, irreversibility, and life-preservation — all enforced in hardware below the OS.

Status: Detailed, buildable specification. Seeking national pilot in finance, energy, or robotics.

Core components (all classical, 5–20 µs added latency on 5 nm / 3 nm):
- Traykov Decision Coherence (TDC) – canary vector + multi-sample + drift monitor
- Judicial Veto Lane (JVL) – non-bypassable hardware kill
- Post-Quantum Receipts (LEI=1)
- Aim Coherence Score (ACS) – single regulatory metric
