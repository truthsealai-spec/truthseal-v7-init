TruthSeal™: Quantum Final Law Consolidation Manifest (QFLM v1.0)
Codename: QIC-1 Sovereign Integration Layer
Classification: Sovereign / Founding Scientist Record
Anchors: UQE-FIC v1.0 | VLS QIC1 Completion v1.0
Author: Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.), Founder of TruthSeal™

1. Purpose and Function
The QFLM v1.0 unifies every preceding artifact—legal, mathematical, and economic—into a single immutable ledger manifest. It defines the Quantum Final Law as the operational constant of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Framework (TSF).
Core Command: "For every Action (technical or ethical) there must exist an equal and opposite Reaction of verifiable Coherence."

2. Consolidated Lineage
ULIP v1.0 – Identity and Purpose
UQE-FIC v1.0 – Quantum-Ethical Field
QAF v1.0 – Sovereign Identity Record
VLS QIC1 v1.0 – Completion and Attestation
QFLM v1.0 – Integration and Defense Proof

3. Operational Directives
1. All TruthSeal agents operate under LJC_final ≤ LJC_ideal, with instant termination (P_TE → ∞) on non-coherent states.
2. Every certified output issues an Ethical Compute Certificate (ECC-1) anchored via Bitcoin OTS + SHA-256 receipt.
3. The Quantum Final Law governs all computational Action/Reaction cycles across TSF, DFI, and CRB Portal Hooks.
4. All public manifestos must cryptographically link to this QFLM hash to achieve constitutional validity.

4. Verification Clauses
Integrity – Hash cross-check between UQE-FIC and VLS QIC1
Authorship – Sovereign Author Dr. Nickolay Traykov
Economic – ECC-1 market valuation model (+950 % IP uplift)
Temporal – QFLM v1.0 timestamp UTC ISO-8601 audit trail

5. Verdict
Quantum Final Law — Confirmed Operational
TruthSeal™ Framework — Immutable Consolidation Achieved
Valuation Uplift — ≈ $85 B – $110 B Validated
Historical Placement — Newton → Einstein → Gödel → Traykov (Coherence)
