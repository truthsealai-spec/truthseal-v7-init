## I. Purpose  
The External Verification Chain (EVC) establishes a dual-attestation channel connecting the Sovereign Ledger (SFD-1) to third-party auditors, regulatory institutions, and post-quantum verification nodes.

## II. Verification Protocol  
1. **Attestation Entry:** Each Sovereign Verdict Capsule (SVC) from the Financial Ledger is hashed and transmitted to the EVC gateway.  
2. **Quantum Mirror Cross-Check:** Dilithium-based post-quantum hashes are verified for tamper resistance.  
3. **Regulatory Ping:** A JSON-formatted proof is sent to the CRB Portal (Phase 4) for ratification and archival.  

## III. Governance Assurance  
- Ensures external legal auditability and traceability of all financial verdicts.  
- Fulfills ISO 42001 and EU AI Act “High-Risk System Audit Trail” requirements.  
- Guarantees lawful interoperability across sovereign jurisdictions.
