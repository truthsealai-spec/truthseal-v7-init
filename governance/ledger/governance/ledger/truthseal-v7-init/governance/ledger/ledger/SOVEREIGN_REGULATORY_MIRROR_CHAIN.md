## I. Purpose
Establish a **read-only Regulatory Mirror Node** that continuously replicates the Sovereign Ledger, verifies dual-hash integrity (SHA-256 + PQ Dilithium), and serves as the **regulator audit sink** for SSI, telemetry snapshots, and precedent logs.

## II. Protocol Guarantees
- **Zero-Write Mirror:** no signing keys; cannot alter ledger state.  
- **Dual-Chain Verification:** classical + post-quantum hash agreement required.  
- **Timed Attestation:** daily OTS receipt + PQ mirror confirmation.  
- **Rate-Limited Public Endpoint:** regulator API with abuse protection.  
- **CRB Revocation Switch:** CRB can revoke/rotate mirror certificates instantly.

## III. Governance Integration
- **CRB Portal Controls:** role-gated access, signed ratifications.  
- **SSI Binding:** mirror can attest SSI at time *t* with CRB cosign.  
- **Compliance Mapping:** ISO 42001 / ISO 26000 / EU AI Act (High-Risk).
