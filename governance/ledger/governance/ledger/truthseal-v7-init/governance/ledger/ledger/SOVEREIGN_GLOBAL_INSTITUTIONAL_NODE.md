## I. Purpose
Establish the **Global Institutional Access Node (GIN)** to allow verified national or inter-institutional entities to interface with the Sovereign Ledger under TruthSeal™ law.  
Provides controlled interoperability for audits, certifications, and cross-sovereign integrity proofs.

---

## II. Functions
- **Institutional Gateway:** Read-only federated access to ledger data for recognized governments and AI oversight bodies.  
- **Diplomatic Ledger Exchange:** Allows attested data mirroring between sovereign jurisdictions without loss of constitutional integrity.  
- **Compliance API:** Standardized REST endpoint aligned to ISO 42001 and EU AI Act for real-time status and telemetry queries.  
- **Institutional KYC Protocol:** Each entity is assigned a GIN-Cert using post-quantum signature algorithms (Dilithium Level 5).  

---

## III. Governance Clauses
- **CRB Oversight:** All institutional onboardings require CRB ratification.  
- **Revocation Logic:** GIN certificates are bound to 24 h revocation check through TPM quote verification.  
- **Continuity Mandate:** Every new jurisdictional integration must mirror the latest constitutional version (ULIC Continuum).
