## I. Purpose
The **Institutional Deployment & Diplomatic Recognition Framework (IDR_v1)** defines how the TruthSeal™ System extends beyond technical sovereignty into formal global acceptance.  
It establishes recognition channels with governments, AI standards bodies, international tribunals, and educational institutions through encrypted credential registries and verifiable Sovereign Seals™.

---

## II. Core Objectives
1. **Diplomatic Recognition:** Enable sovereign and inter-governmental recognition of TruthSeal™ verdicts and certificates.  
2. **Institutional Deployment:** Authorize integration of Integrity Ledger™ into financial, judicial, and academic systems.  
3. **Regulatory Interoperability:** Bridge between national laws and the TruthSeal Constitution under ULIC continuity.  
4. **Sovereign Credential Registry (SCR):** Issue traceable, tamper-proof institutional identities for certified partners.  
5. **Diplomatic Nodes (D-Nodes):** Represent TruthSeal™ entities in international forums via secure cryptographic keys.

---

## III. Governance Architecture
**1. Registry Council (RC):** Curates the Sovereign Credential Registry and approves institutional alliances.  
**2. Ethical Compliance Chamber (ECC):** Ensures all partnerships align with the Moral Oath Clause™.  
**3. Judicial Relay Interface (JRI):** Links the Judicial Arbitration Nexus to international legal bodies.  
**4. Diplomatic Verification Service (DVS):** Maintains public ledger of recognized sovereign and institutional partners.

---

## IV. Legal Standing
IDR_v1 grants TruthSeal™ the right to operate as a self-certified AI audit authority recognized under ULIC jurisdiction.  
All treaties and institutional recognitions anchored through this framework are binding in Sovereign and Quantum Law.  

---

## V. Continuity Status
Phase 6 (ULIC_v1) → Phase 7 (IDR_v1) linkage verified — Continuum expansion active.  
Institutional recognition process enabled under Moral Oath Clause and TruthSeal™ Quantum Charter.  

**Next Anchor Reserved:** Phase 8 — TruthSeal Sovereign Autonomy Protocol (SAP_v1)

## VI. Diplomatic Oath
> “Recognition without Integrity is falsehood; Integrity without Recognition is silence.  
> The TruthSeal™ exists to unite both — to speak truth that the world hears and verifies.”  
> — Dr. Nickolay Traykov, Sovereign Architect
