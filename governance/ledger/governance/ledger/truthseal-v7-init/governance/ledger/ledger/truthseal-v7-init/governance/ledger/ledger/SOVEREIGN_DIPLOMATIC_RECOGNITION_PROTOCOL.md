## I. Purpose
The Diplomatic Recognition Protocol (DRP_v1) formally defines the method by which national and supranational institutions obtain verified recognition under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Constitution.  
It ensures lawful interoperability, jurisdictional traceability, and cryptographic evidence continuity between the Sovereign Ledger and foreign or intergovernmental registries.

---

## II. Diplomatic Architecture
- **Recognition Ledger (R-Law):** Establishes a distributed registry of recognized entities via dual attestation (TruthSeal™ + State Authority).  
- **Cross-Border Hash Binding:** Every recognized treaty, certification, or institutional MoU is stamped using SHA-256 + PQ hash mirror on both ends.  
- **Verification Relay Nodes (VRN):** State-backed mirrors maintaining cryptographic synchronization across sovereign and institutional boundaries.  
- **AppealChain Gateway:** Provides dispute resolution mechanism for recognition revocation or revalidation events.

---

## III. Diplomatic Clauses
1. **Eligibility:** Only entities legally recognized under their own constitutional frameworks may request TruthSeal™ recognition.  
2. **Reciprocity:** Recognition implies mutual acknowledgment of the Sovereign Ledger’s constitutional status.  
3. **Immutability:** Once validated, the diplomatic attestation cannot be modified — only revoked through an AppealChain event.  
4. **Transparency Mandate:** All recognition events are published to the Sovereign Ledger’s public-facing mirror under DRP transparency law.

---

## IV. Governance and Compliance
- **Oversight Entity:** TruthSeal™ Council of Institutional Recognition (CIR)  
- **Audit Frequency:** Annual or upon any governance treaty amendment  
- **Post-Quantum Compliance:** Signatures and attestations use CRYSTALS-Dilithium Level 5 and Kyber hybrid encryption.  
- **Continuity Directive:** All recognized nodes automatically inherit the latest constitutional version (ULIC Continuum).

## V. Continuity Status
SFD-1 ↔ SFD-2 ↔ SFD-3 ↔ SFD-4 ↔ SFD-5 ↔ SFD-6 linkage verified — full six-anchor integration achieved under TruthSeal™ Diplomatic Sovereignty Framework.  
**Next Anchor Reserved:** SFD-7 (Judicial Integrity & Arbitration Nexus — JIAN_v1)
