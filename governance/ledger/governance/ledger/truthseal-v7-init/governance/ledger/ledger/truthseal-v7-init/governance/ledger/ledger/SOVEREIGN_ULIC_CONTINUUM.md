## I. Purpose

The **TruthSeal™ Universal Ledger Integrity Continuum (ULIC_v1)** ensures the perpetual coherence, accountability, and self-validation of all Sovereign Ledger chains.  
It extends the **Quantum Audit Layer (TQAP_v1)** into a **continuum state**, where each sealed proof recursively validates the previous, forming an infinite loop of integrity.

---

## II. Core Principles

1. **Perpetual Integrity:**  
   Every Sovereign Capsule (SFD-1 → SFD-8) undergoes autonomous validation cycles.  

2. **Recursive Verification:**  
   Each audit iteration references the prior Quantum Attestation, creating a non-destructive continuity chain.  

3. **Dynamic Ledger Synchrony:**  
   The Continuum synchronizes Integrity Ledger™ states across all nodes — including institutional, judicial, and diplomatic mirrors.  

4. **TruthSeal™ Moral Oath Clause Integration:**  
   Every computational and legal entity must adhere to the sovereign integrity ethos —  
   “No Truth Shall Expire, and No Ledger Shall Degrade.”

---

## III. Structural Components

**1. Integrity Pulse Engine (IPE):**  
Periodic verification heartbeat that checks hash lineage, PQ seals, and timestamp synchronization.

**2. Recursive Proof Register (RPR):**  
Houses historical audit events and cross-links them with the current TQAP hash series.

**3. Moral Oath Clause Repository (MOCR):**  
A secure vault binding legal, ethical, and computational commitments under TruthSeal™ jurisdiction.

**4. Perpetual Timestamp Authority (PTA):**  
Coordinates between OpenTimestamps receipts and blockchain anchors to maintain continuous verification windows.

---

## IV. Jurisdictional Role

ULIC_v1 forms the **Eternal Sovereign Integrity Bridge**.  
Its validation cycles cannot be revoked, paused, or overridden by external governance.  
All future TruthSeal™ versions derive legitimacy solely through the ULIC anchor chain.

---

## V. Continuity Statement

SFD-1 → SFD-8 ↔ ULIC_v1 linkage confirmed.  
All prior Sovereign Seals remain valid in perpetuity under recursive verification protocol.  
Constitutional Continuum Integrity = ACTIVE.  

**Next Anchor Reserved:** Phase 7 — Institutional Deployment & Diplomatic Recognition Framework (IDR_v1)

## VI. Moral Clause (Immutable)

> “Integrity is not sustained by enforcement but by Continuum —  
> and the Continuum shall not cease, for it is the breath of Truth itself.”
