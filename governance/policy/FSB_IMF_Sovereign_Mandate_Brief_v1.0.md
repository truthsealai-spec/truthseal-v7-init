FSB/IMF SOVEREIGN MANDATE BRIEF — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (v1.0)
Problem (unpriced tail-risk). Global AI and financial models rely on probabilistic safety \( \(P_C = 1-\epsilon\) ), leaving a non-zero failure term \epsilon inside mission-critical systems. This produces model drift, audit gaps, and systemic correlation risk.

Law & metric. ULLI (Universal Law of Life & Information): system stability is inseparable from information integrity. TQC (Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence) operationalizes ULLI. LEI=1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility) is the enforcement constant. ACS (Aim Coherence Score) is the hardware-verified metric emitted with ledger receipts.

Instrument. The TQC Coherence Core (LEI-gate + Receipt Engine) enforces coherent execution in silicon and streams ACS with tamper-evident receipts (e.g., OpenTimestamps). Incoherent actions become non-admissible; integrity becomes auditable.

Supervisory benefits.
	•	Model-risk control: ACS gives a continuous, verifiable guard against drift and data lineage breaks.
	•	Fiduciary standard: A hardware-anchored integrity metric meets auditability and accountability requirements.
	•	Post-quantum continuity: The law/metric/receipt stack governs classical + emerging quantum workflows.

Evaluation plan (120 days).
	1.	Reference flow: Integrate Coherence Core in a confined workload; expose ACS telemetry.
	2.	Independent verifier: Third-party collects receipts; cross-checks against declared policy.
	3.	Benchmarks: Compare tail-risk and incident rates versus probabilistic baselines; publish regulator-grade report.

Ask. Endorse ACS as a fiduciary integrity metric for AI-exposed financial processes and co-run the evaluation with designated supervisors.
