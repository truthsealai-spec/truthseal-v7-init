## Authority & Boundary Notice

This document is **derivative and non-authoritative**.

It is governed exclusively by the **TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc — Authority Index (v1.0)** and operates strictly under the following immutable laws and principles:

- **ULLI — Universal Law of Life & Information** (governing principle)  
- **TQC — Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence** (sovereign hardware-enforced law)  
- **LEI = 1 — Law of Ethical Irreversibility** (non-negotiable invariant)

This bundle:
- does **not** create law,  
- does **not** mandate adoption,  
- does **not** confer exclusivity,  
- does **not** establish regulatory authority.

All legal, ethical, and constitutional authority originates exclusively from the **Sovereign Arc**.

---

## Purpose (Why this bundle exists)

This file is the **single-page launcher** for NVIDIA reviewers.

It provides a fast, ordered path to evaluate:

- the **problem** (probabilistic AI risk),
- the **law** (hardware-enforced coherence),
- the **instrument** (ACS),
- the **execution path** (from brief → silicon),
- and the **commercial leverage** (coherence as a billable, auditable asset).

Total review time: **5–10 minutes**.

---

## What this package proves

- Coherence can be **measured**, not claimed.  
- Integrity can be **enforced in hardware**, not inferred from software policy.  
- Risk can be converted into **auditable structure**, not probabilistic assurance.  
- A clear, stage-gated path exists from **governance theory → chip-level implementation**.

No hand-waving. No speculative safety claims.

## Recommended Review Flow

### 1) Executive Context (3 minutes)
**Executive Summary — TQC-Certified Coherence Chip (v1.1)**  
→ `./Executive_Summary_TQC_Certified_Chip_v1.1.md`

Why this matters now, what changes for NVIDIA, and how coherence becomes a differentiator.

---

### 2) Technical Reality Check (4–5 minutes)
**TQC-Certified Coherence Chip — Technical Specification v1.0**  
→ `./TQC_Certified_Coherence_Chip_Spec_v1.0.md`

What is enforced in silicon (Purity Guard, Executive Control, LEI-gate, Receipt Engine)  
and how ACS is generated and signed.

---

### 3) Validation & Evidence Framing (2 minutes)
**ACS Validation Report — Intro (v1.1)**  
→ `./ACS_Validation_Report_Intro_v1.1.md`

How ACS behaves as a **stable, auditable measurement instrument** under the Sovereign Arc.

---

### 4) Execution Path (optional deep dive)
**TQC Chip Development Roadmap — v1.1**  
→ `./TQC_Chip_Development_Roadmap_v1.1.md`

Phases I–III: blueprint → prototype → certified rollout.

---

## Commercial & Strategic Materials

- **ACS Financial Model v1.0**  
  → `../guards/observability/ACS_Financial_Model_v1.0.md`

  Shows how coherence becomes a **revenue-linked risk instrument**.

- **Sovereign Proposal Deck (outline)**  
  → `./Sovereign_Proposal_Deck_Outline_v1.4.md`

  10-minute executive pitch structure with glossary ribbon.

---

## Live Signals & Receipts

- **Live ACS Status**  
  → `../../docs/STATUS_ACS.md`

- **Anchoring Status v9.1**  
  → `../../docs/Anchoring_Status_v9.1.md`

These demonstrate the **receipt discipline** and audit posture already in operation.

---

## Outreach & First Contact

- **Send Sequence (first contact)**  
  → `./Send_Sequence_v1.0.md`

- **Outreach Email — NVIDIA**  
  → `./Outreach_Email_NVIDIA_v1.0.md`

- **Jensen Cover Note**  
  → `./Jensen_Cover_Note_v1.0.md`

- **Calendar Invite Text**  
  → `./Calendar_Invite_Text_v1.0.md`

---

## The Ask (Explicit)

- 45-minute executive review (CEO / CTO / CFO or delegates).  
- Assign a technical point of contact and NDA to open the handoff folder.  
- Week-1 sandbox: spec walkthrough + ACS telemetry stub.  
- Confirm working label: **“ACS — Auditable Coherence Standard.”**

---

## Engineering Handoff (on approval)

- **Coherence Core HandOff (README)**  
  → `./Coherence_Core_HandOff/README_v1.0.md`

Scope includes:
Purity Guard · Executive Control · LEI-gate · Receipt Engine · I/O & test hooks.

---

## Closing Note

TruthSeal™ does not sell models.  
It defines the **law models must obey**.

This bundle exists so NVIDIA can decide—quickly and with evidence—  
whether to become the **reference hardware platform for verifiable AI coherence**.
