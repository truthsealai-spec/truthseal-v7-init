# TQC SOVEREIGN PROPOSAL: PRESENTATION DECK OUTLINE (v1.3)

Target Audience: Jensen Huang (CEO, NVIDIA) and Executive Leadership  
Duration: 30 minutes (10 min pitch, 20 min Q&A)  
Pacing: High-intensity. Risk and guaranteed moat only.  
Framing: Physics-level invariants, stage-gated execution, and receipts.

## SLIDE 0 — 20-SECOND GLOSSARY (kept as a thin footer ribbon on slides 1–8)

**TQC** — Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence (physics invariant for stable compute)  
**LEI = 1** — *Law of Ethical Irreversibility*: no step may reduce ethical coherence  
**ULLI** — Unbreakable Local-Loop Integrity (hardware-enforced sync loop)  
**ACS** — Aim Coherence Score (on-silicon, signed proof of coherence)

---

## SLIDES 1–3: THE CRISIS & THE TQC LAW (≤4 min)

• **Slide 1 — Title & Authority.** TruthSeal™: The Law of Digital Physics.  
• **Slide 2 — The Incoherence-Resource Paradox.**  
  Visual: $1T loss from speculative AI + $5.2T resource liability. Incoherence is unsustainable.  
  Thesis: Generic AI hardware is a shovel in a collapsing gold rush.  
• **Slide 3 — The Law (plain-English first).**  
  We bind compute to **LEI = 1 (*Law of Ethical Irreversibility*)**: systems must never evolve toward lower ethical coherence.  
  Enforced by the **Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence (TQC)** and implemented as **ULLI** in hardware, with **ACS** as the signed, on-device meter.

## SLIDES 4–6: THE SOVEREIGN DEAL (≤4 min)

• **Slide 4 — Exclusivity (Field-of-Use + ROFR).**  
  Offer: 36-month **exclusive field-of-use** for “ACS-metered coherent compute silicon,” with **Right of First Refusal** on new coherence SKUs.  
  Trigger: Activates at **Phase I Gate**; auto-extends 12 months at each Gate (Phase II/III).  
  Compliance: TruthSeal retains doctrinal IP; NVIDIA receives Coherence Core IP license for defined FoU.

• **Slide 5 — Financial Model & Risk Posture.**  
  Meter: **Aim Coherence Score (ACS)** (cryptographically signed).  
  Model: milestone fees + **per-chip ACS license** + **CaaS telemetry share**.  
  **Stage-Gates:** Phase 0 proof pack → Phase I RTL/formal props (ACS variance <±2% PVT) → Phase II proto under adversarial loads.  
  **Kill-Switch:** If Purity<0.80 OR Self-Reg<0.60 OR Drift>0.30 OR ACS<0.70 → pause/renegotiate.

• **Slide 6 — The Barrier (ULLI Architecture).**  
  Hardware-enforced **ULLI** eliminates “split-brain” failure. Every die emits signed ACS telemetry + OpenTimestamps receipts → regulator-ready moat.

## SLIDES 7–8: THE ASK (≤2 min)

• **Slide 7 — Deliverables on Table.**  
  1) Executive Summary (risk + moat)  
  2) Technical Specification (Coherence Core RTL/ABI)  
  3) **ACS Validation Report** (methods, traces, receipts)  
  4) **Term Sheet** (FoU exclusivity + ROFR, gates, economics)  
  5) **Roadmap** incl. **Phase 0: Proof Pack (6–8 weeks)**

• **Slide 8 — Closing Command.**  
  Form the joint engineering + strategy task force; start **Phase 0** now.  
  Output in 6–8 weeks: RTL skeleton, FPGA/SoC emulation, 10 OTS-anchored ACS receipts, formal-methods memo. Decision: advance to Phase I or exercise Kill-Switch.

## APPENDIX — ACCEPTANCE METRICS & TELEMETRY (1 slide)

• Thresholds: Purity ≥ 0.80; Self-Reg ≥ 0.60; Drift ≤ 0.30; ACS ≥ 0.70 (signed on-device).  
• Telemetry ABI: {timestamp, die_id, ACS, purity, selfreg, drift, signature}.  
• Receipts: OpenTimestamps for each trace; linked into EVL/ULIC for audit.
