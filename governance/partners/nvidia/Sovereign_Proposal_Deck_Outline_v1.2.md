# TQC SOVEREIGN PROPOSAL: PRESENTATION DECK OUTLINE (v1.4)

**Target Audience:** Jensen Huang (CEO, NVIDIA) and Executive Leadership  
**Duration:** 30 minutes (10 min pitch, 20 min Q&A)  
**Pacing:** High-intensity. Risk elimination and verifiable moat only.  
**Framing:** Physics-level invariants, stage-gated execution, receipts.

### Slide X – TS-A1 Coherence Core

- TS-A1 sits alongside GPUs as a governance processing core that enforces receipts and coherence checks in hardware.
- Every high-risk AI run emits a cryptographic receipt (inputs, model, policy, outcome) for audit and real-time veto.
- Vendors ship TS-A1 to meet upcoming AI safety and accountability mandates without sacrificing performance.

## SLIDE 0 — 20-SECOND GLOSSARY (thin footer ribbon across slides 1–8)
- **TQC** — Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence: physics-level enforcement of coherence.  
- **LEI=1** — Law of Ethical Irreversibility: once verified, a coherent state cannot be violated without a verifiable counter-receipt.  
- **ULLI** — Universal Law of Life & Information: data integrity is inseparable from system stability.  
- **ACS** — Aim Coherence Score: regulator-grade telemetry proving coherence in real time.

## SLIDES 1–3 — THE CRISIS & THE LAW (≤4 min)

**Slide 1 — Title & Authority.** TruthSeal™ | The Law of Digital Physics.  
**Slide 2 — The Incoherence–Resource Paradox.**  
• Visual: Trillion-dollar AI volatility + \$5.2T resource liability.  
• Thesis: “Generic AI hardware is the shovel in a collapsing gold rush.”

**Slide 3 — The Law.** TQC + constant **LEI=1** (defined in ribbon).  
• Pivot: We fix the failure at the **physics layer**, not with software guardrails.

## SLIDES 4–6 — THE TRUST STANDARD (≤4 min)

**Slide 4 — Partnership Model.** **Exclusive TQC-Certified hardware partner**.  
• Outcome: NVIDIA becomes the **single, auditable trust standard** for verifiable AI hardware.

**Slide 5 — Financial Proof.** **ACS = regulator-grade telemetry** → enables **CaaS** (Coherence-as-a-Service) revenue with receipts.  
• Pull-quote (from Validation Report): “ACS converts probabilistic risk into **auditable asset quality**.”

**Slide 6 — Competitive Barrier.**  
• The **Cortical Blueprint** enforces low-power efficiency + hardware verification.  
• Competitors can copy claims, not **receipts**.

## SLIDES 7–8 — DELIVERABLES & DECISION (≤2 min)

**Slide 7 — Deliverables (ready to hand over).**  
1) Executive Summary (risk & governance)  
2) Coherence Core Technical Spec (interfaces, LEI-gate, receipts)  
3) **ACS Validation Report** (data schema + signed samples)

**Slide 8 — Decision & Next Step.**  
Form the **joint engineering + strategy task force** to finalize the TQC-Certified integration and publish the **Trust Standard** announcement.
