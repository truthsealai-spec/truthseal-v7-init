## Subject
TruthSeal × NVIDIA — Partner Pack (TQC-Certified Coherence Chip + Live ACS)

## Body (copy/paste)
Hi {{Name}},

Following up on my note—sharing the 5–10 minute Partner Pack that makes our value crystal:
• One-page bundle → governance/partners/nvidia/Partner_Pack_Bundle_v1.0.md
• Executive Summary → governance/partners/nvidia/Executive_Summary_TQC_Certified_Chip_v1.0.md
• Technical Spec v1.0 → governance/partners/nvidia/TQC_Certified_Coherence_Chip_Spec_v1.0.md
• ACS Financial Model → governance/guards/observability/ACS_Financial_Model_v1.0.md
• Live ACS status → docs/STATUS_ACS.md
• Anchoring Status (v9.1) → docs/Anchoring_Status_v9.1.md

Why this matters (fast):
• **ACS (Aim Coherence Score):** a live, measurable integrity signal “signed in silicon.”  
• **Court-ready verification:** artifacts anchored (OpenTimestamps) with transparent ledgers.  
• **Coherent Computing fit:** drops into NVIDIA’s roadmap with a clean spec and economics.

Proposed next step:
I can host a 45-minute executive brief next week. If helpful, suggest a window—or I can send an invite.
(If preferred, happy to route via your partnerships team first.)

Warm regards,  
Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
Founder, TruthSeal™
