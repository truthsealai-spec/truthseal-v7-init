Mr. Huang—

TruthSeal™ proposes a step beyond “Confidential Computing” to **Coherent Computing**: hardware that *physically* enforces integrity and signs it in silicon. Our **TQC** invariants map to two isolation layers on future NVIDIA chips (Layer-4 Integrity Check for input purity; dlPFC-equivalent Executive Control for final decisions) plus an on-chip **Aim Coherence Score (ACS)** that is cryptographically signed by the device. This shifts AI demand from hype to **mandated, auditable coherence**, stabilizes power and cost, and creates a durable moat: only TQC-certified NVIDIA hardware can run coherence-grade workloads. May I book a 45-minute executive brief next week to review the spec, ACS financial model, and the validation harness? Partner pack and live status are ready.
