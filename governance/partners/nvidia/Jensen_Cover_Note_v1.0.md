TruthSeal × NVIDIA — Coherent Computing Partner Pack (v1.0)

## Email — Body (copy/paste)
Hi {{Name}},

I’m Dr. Nickolay Traykov, founder of TruthSeal™. We’ve built a court-ready coherence framework for AI systems and a TQC-Certified Coherence Chip spec that makes integrity *measurable*: the Aim Coherence Score (ACS).

I’ve prepared a 5–10 minute Partner Pack for your quick review:
• One-page bundle → governance/partners/nvidia/Partner_Pack_Bundle_v1.0.md  
• Executive Summary → governance/partners/nvidia/Executive_Summary_TQC_Certified_Chip_v1.0.md  
• Technical Spec v1.0 → governance/partners/nvidia/TQC_Certified_Coherence_Chip_Spec_v1.0.md  
• ACS Financial Model → governance/guards/observability/ACS_Financial_Model_v1.0.md  
• Live ACS status → docs/STATUS_ACS.md  
• Anchoring Status (v9.1) → docs/Anchoring_Status_v9.1.md

If useful, I’d welcome a 45-minute executive brief next week. 
Kindly suggest a window, or I can send a calendar invite.

Warm regards,  
Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
Founder, TruthSeal™

Hi {{Name}} — I lead TruthSeal™. We’ve packaged a 5–10 min Partner Pack on verifiable AI coherence and our TQC-Certified Coherence Chip spec (with live ACS signal + financial model). If this aligns with NVIDIA’s “Coherent Computing” trajectory, happy to share and schedule a 45-min brief next week. Can I send the one-pager?
