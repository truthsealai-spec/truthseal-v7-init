# NVIDIA Partner Pack — Index (v1.0)

TruthSeal™ AEGIS™ TS-A1 is a **governance processing core** that sits alongside GPUs and accelerators, enforcing **cryptographic receipts** and **coherence checks in hardware** for high-risk artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging artificial general intelligence (AGI) workloads, secured with **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**.

This index is the **single launcher** for NVIDIA reviewers.  
One place to open every asset fast, in the correct authority order.

## Partner Boundary (Authority Gate)
Before any technical, commercial, or roadmap material, all content in this folder operates **strictly under**:

- **TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc — Authority Index (v1.0)**  
- **ULLI — Universal Law of Life & Information**  
- **TQC — Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence**  
- **LEI = 1 — Law of Ethical Irreversibility**

No document in this pack creates law, mandate, exclusivity, or regulatory authority.  
All materials are **derivative, non-authoritative**, and implementation-scoped only.

---

## What this package proves
- Physics-level coherence enforcement (not software guardrails)
- Hardware-attested auditability with cryptographic receipts
- A stage-gated, regulator-credible path from executive brief → silicon
- Zero hand-wave, zero unverifiable claims
