**File:** governance/partners/nvidia/README.md  
**Purpose:** One-stop index for NVIDIA reviewers: what this is, why it matters, and where to click.

## Quick links
- Executive Summary → `governance/partners/nvidia/Executive_Summary_TQC_Certified_Chip_v1.0.md`
- Technical Specification v1.0 → `governance/partners/nvidia/TQC_Certified_Coherence_Chip_Spec_v1.0.md`
- Aim Coherence Score Financial Model v1.0 → `governance/guards/observability/ACS_Financial_Model_v1.0.md`
- Live ACS Status (Aim Coherence Score) → `docs/STATUS_ACS.md`

## Plain terms (no acronyms left unexplained)
- **TQC (Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence):** physics-grounded invariants that force truthful operation.
- **LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility):** long-term truth must win at the decision layer.
- **ACS (Aim Coherence Score):** continuous integrity score produced and signed in silicon.

## 3-minute review flow
1) Read the Executive Summary.  
2) Skim the Spec’s mandates (Layer-4 Integrity & dlPFC Executive Control).  
3) Check Live ACS Status and the Financial Model for revenue logic.

*Contact & status:* Patent prep (Path A) in progress; partner brief iterating. This pack is source-controlled and will be timestamp-anchored.
