# NVIDIA Partner Pack — Index (v1.0)
TruthSeal AEGIS™ TS-A1 is a governance processing core that sits alongside
GPUs and accelerators, enforcing cryptographic receipts and coherence checks
in hardware so that high-risk AI workloads have a deterministic, auditable
safety and accountability layer.
TruthSeal™ AEGIS™ TS-A1 is a governance processing core that sits alongside GPUs and accelerators, enforcing cryptographic receipts and coherence checks in hardware for high-risk artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging artificial general intelligence (AGI) workloads, secured with post-quantum cryptography (PQC).

## What this package proves
Physics-level coherence, auditability, and a stage-gated path from brief to silicon—zero hand-wave.

## Primary docs
1) Sovereign_Proposal_Deck_Outline_v1.4.md — 10-min pitch + footer glossary ribbon.
2) ACS_Validation_Report_Intro_v1.1.md — market risk → constant (LEI=1) → instrument (ACS).
3) TQC_Chip_Development_Roadmap_v1.1.md — Phases I–III to land the Coherence Core.
4) Execution_Authority_Claim_v1.0.md — dual-track plan and standards posture.
5) Coherence_Core_HandOff/README_v1.0.md — scope (Purity Guard, Exec Control, LEI-gate, Receipt Engine), I/O, and test hooks.
6)  TS-A1_Hardware_Law_v1.0.md → governance/guards/standards/TS-A1_Hardware_Law_v1.0.md

## The ask (NVIDIA)
- 45-min executive review window (Jensen + CTO + CFO).
- Assign technical POC + NDA to open the handoff folder.
- Week-1 sandbox: spec walkthrough + ACS telemetry stub.
- Confirm standard label: “ACS — Auditable Coherence Standard”.

## Receipts & guardrails
- Ledger/anchoring: see `governance/ledger/Anchoring_Status_v9.1.md`.
- Actions gates: `.github/workflows/acs_pr_gate.yml` (PR gate) and `truthseal_leakscan.yml` (leak scan).
