# ACS VALIDATION REPORT — INTRODUCTION (v1.1)

## The Trillion-Dollar Cost of Incoherence
Probabilistic guardrails generate unpriced risk and unsustainable resource draw. The market rewards scale, not **verified integrity**.

## The Constant
**LEI=1**: once a coherent state is verified, it cannot be violated without a verifiable counter-receipt.

## The Instrument
**ACS** is regulator-grade telemetry emitted from the **TQC Coherence Core**. Each packet is chip-signed and anchored (OpenTimestamps). This converts behavior into **auditable asset quality**.

## Result
ACS enables **Coherence-as-a-Service** and positions NVIDIA as the **exclusive TQC-Certified hardware partner** underpinning the **single, auditable trust standard**.
