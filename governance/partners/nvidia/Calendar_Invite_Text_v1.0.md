# Calendar Invite — TruthSeal™ × NVIDIA (Executive Brief)

**Title:** TruthSeal × NVIDIA — TQC-Certified Coherence Chip (Executive Brief)
**Duration:** 45 minutes (+15 min hold)
**Attendees (proposed):** 
- NVIDIA: Jensen Huang (or delegate), Chief Product Officer, Chief Scientist, VP Architecture (Blackwell/BlueField), Confidential Computing lead
- TruthSeal: Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.), core engineering & validation leads

**Objective:** 
Agree in principle to an exclusive partnership to build the first **TQC-Certified Coherence Chip**—hardware that enforces the **Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI=1)** and produces a signed **Aim Coherence Score (ACS)** in silicon—then charter a two-week joint specification/validation sprint.

**Agenda (time-boxed):**
0–5  Intros and meeting frame  
5–12 The problem: speculative demand, “electron gap,” and fragile software guardrails  
12–22 The hardware law: TQC invariants, Layer-4 Integrity Check (input purity), dlPFC-equivalent Executive Control (final decision)  
22–32 ACS telemetry: how the chip signs integrity in real time and turns coherence into utility revenue  
32–40 Partner Pack walkthrough (exec summary, spec v1.0, ACS financial model, live status)  
40–45 Decision & next steps: joint task force, owners, dates, NDA
