Hardware-Attested Integrity for High-Risk AI — 120-Day Pilot Proposal

Email — Body (copy/paste)

Dear {{Name}},

My name is Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.), founder of TruthSeal™. I am writing to share a concise regulatory brief and propose a contained 120-day pilot on hardware-attested integrity for high-risk automated decisions.

TruthSeal™ is an integrity layer for advanced computing systems. We bind high-risk automated decisions to cryptographic receipts and hardware-backed coherence checks, so that supervisors can independently verify who did what, under which policy, and with which model version — and, if necessary, stop incoherent or non-compliant runs in real time.

Attached is the following document:

- **FSB/IMF Regulatory Brief — Converting Unpriced Tail-Risk into Structural Certainty (v1.2, Private)**  
  Path: `governance/partners/nvidia/FSB_IMF_Regulatory_Brief_v1.2.md`

This brief is strictly vendor-neutral and frames a simple supervisory instrument:

1. Every high-risk run emits a tamper-evident cryptographic receipt (inputs, model, policy, outputs, time).
2. The hardware exposes a verifiable veto lane that can pause or block incoherent or non-compliant runs.
3. An Aim Coherence Score (ACS) and associated receipts provide a measurable disclosure of structural integrity over a defined pilot window (120 days).

Our proposal is to work with a small group of institutions, under your guidance, to:

- Select one or two representative high-risk workflows.
- Instrument them with receipts and a veto lane using a governance processing core (TS-A1).
- Report back with concrete evidence on how much unpriced tail-risk can be converted into auditable, structurally certain behavior — without degrading performance.

If this is of interest, I would be honoured to schedule a short briefing to walk you through the brief and discuss possible pilot parameters.

Respectfully,

Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)
