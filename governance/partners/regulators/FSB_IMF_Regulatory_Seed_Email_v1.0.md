Hardware-Attested Integrity for High-Risk AI & Emerging AGI Systems — 120-Day Pilot Proposal

Email — Body (copy/paste)

Dear {{Name}},

My name is Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.), founder of TruthSeal™. I am writing to share a concise regulatory brief and propose a contained 120-day pilot on **hardware-attested integrity for high-risk artificial intelligence (AI) and emerging artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems**, secured with **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**.

TruthSeal™ is an integrity and governance layer for high-risk AI and AGI-class workloads. We bind every critical automated decision to cryptographic receipts, hardware-backed coherence checks, and PQC-secured proofs, so that supervisors can independently verify **who did what, under which policy, and with which model version** — and, if necessary, pause or block incoherent or non-compliant AI runs in real time.

Attached is the following document:

• **FSB/IMF Regulatory Brief — Converting Unpriced Tail-Risk into Structural Certainty (v1.2, Private)**  
  Path: `governance/partners/nvidia/FSB_IMF_Regulatory_Brief_v1.2.md`

The brief sets out how hardware-attested integrity and the Aim Coherence Score (ACS) can convert today’s unpriced AI tail-risk into a **structural, auditable disclosure** over a 120-day pilot window — without changing your existing supervisory mandates or favouring any vendor.

If this is of interest, I would welcome a **45-minute technical and supervisory discussion** with your team to walk through:

1. How ACS turns high-risk AI/AGI behaviour into a single integrity metric exposed to supervisors.
2. How hardware-backed receipts and PQC anchoring create a tamper-evident audit trail across models, GPUs, and policies.
3. How a narrow, time-bounded pilot could be structured to respect your governance process and confidentiality requirements.

Thank you for considering this. I would be glad to adapt the pilot framing to your specific jurisdictional or institutional needs.

Kind regards,

Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)
