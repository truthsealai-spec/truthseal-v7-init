Hardware-Attested Integrity for High-Risk AI / AGI — 120-Day Pilot Proposal

Email — Body (copy/paste)

Dear {{Name}},

My name is Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.), founder of TruthSeal™. I am writing to share a concise regulatory brief and propose a contained 120-day pilot on hardware-attested integrity for high-risk **artificial intelligence (AI)** and emerging **advanced-general-intelligence (AGI-class)** systems, secured with **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**.

TruthSeal™ is an integrity and governance layer for high-risk automated decisions in advanced computing systems. We bind those decisions to cryptographic receipts and **hardware-backed coherence checks**, so that supervisors can independently verify **who** did **what**, **under which policy**, and **with which model version** — and, if necessary, stop incoherent or non-compliant AI runs in real time.

Attached is the following document:

- **FSB/IMF Regulatory Brief — Converting Unpriced Tail-Risk into Structural Certainty (v1.2, Private)**  
  Path:  
  `governance/partners/nvidia/FSB_IMF_Regulatory_Brief_v1.2.md`

This brief explains how a **TruthSeal AEGIS™ TS-A1 Hardware Law v1.0** profile can turn today’s opaque AI / AGI model risk into a **structured, auditable instrument**:

- Every high-risk AI / AGI run emits a tamper-evident **cryptographic receipt** (inputs, model version, active policy, outputs, time).
- The hardware exposes a **real-time veto lane** that can pause or block incoherent or non-compliant runs.
- All receipts are verifiable against an **Integrity Manifest** and external timestamping (for example, OpenTimestamps).

The proposed **120-day pilot** would:

1. Select a contained set of high-risk AI / AGI decision flows (e.g., credit approvals, market interventions, critical supervisory analytics).
2. Overlay a TS-A1-style governance core that produces verifiable receipts and veto signals for those flows, without changing the institution’s core models.
3. Produce an **Aim Coherence Score (ACS)** timeline and a short supervisory report that maps how hardware-attested integrity could be reflected in future prudential or operational-risk disclosures.

If this is of interest, I would be glad to schedule a short briefing to walk through:

- The hardware-law profile (TS-A1 Hardware Law v1.0);
- The regulatory brief’s mapping from unpriced AI tail-risk to structural certainty; and
- A concrete 120-day pilot plan tailored to your mandate.

Thank you for your time and for the work you do in safeguarding financial stability in this new AI / AGI era.

With respect,

Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
Founder, TruthSeal™
