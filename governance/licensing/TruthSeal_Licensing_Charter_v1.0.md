**TRUTHSEAL™ LICENSING CHARTER — SOVEREIGN FRAMEWORK v1.0  
Private Governance Instrument — Not for Public Distribution** 

**date_utc: 2025-12-23  
version: 1.0  
authority: Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)**  

---

## 1. Purpose and Standing

This Charter defines the exclusive licensing authority governing the use, deployment, certification, representation, and commercialisation of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework (“the Arc”).

The Arc constitutes a unified body of intellectual property, statutory logic, cryptographic architecture, and governance law. Its use without an explicit license constitutes unauthorised operation under the TruthSeal™ governance regime.

This Charter applies globally and is technology-agnostic.

---

## 2. Scope of Controlled Material

The following are governed by this Charter, whether in whole or in part, directly or derivatively:

- TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc doctrine and statutory hierarchy  
- TQC (Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence)  
- LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility)  
- ACS, TCS, CHS metrics and thresholds  
- TS-A, TS-R, TS-R1, TS-R2, TS-R3 hardware and robotics profiles  
- Receipt schemas, attestation flows, anchoring protocols  
- Any system claiming functional equivalence, compliance, or certification

---

## 3. License Requirement (Non-Negotiable)

Any **operational**, **commercial**, **institutional**, **governmental**, or **embedded** use of the Arc or any derivative governance system requires a valid TruthSeal™ license.

Reading, academic commentary, and non-operational research are permitted **only** where no implementation, enforcement, or claim of compliance occurs.

No license is implied by publication, citation, or availability of documentation.

---

## 4. License Classes (Defined, Not Priced)

Licenses are granted solely at the discretion of TruthSeal™ Pty Ltd and may include:

- **Sovereign License** — national, supranational, or treaty-level adoption  
- **Hardware Vendor License** — silicon, accelerator, robotics, or embedded systems  
- **Enterprise Operator License** — data centres, financial institutions, infrastructure operators  
- **Robotics Fleet License** — humanoid, drone, underwater, swarm, or autonomous fleets  
- **Research & Evaluation License** — time-bound, non-production use

Each class carries distinct obligations, audit rights, and enforcement conditions.

---

## 5. Certification and Mark Usage

No party may represent, market, certify, or imply:

- “TruthSeal-compliant”  
- “TQC-certified”  
- “ACS-governed”  
- “TS-R governed”  

without written authorisation and active certification.

Unauthorised mark usage constitutes misrepresentation and governance breach.

---

## 6. Enforcement, Audit, and Revocation

TruthSeal™ reserves the right to:

- Require cryptographic proof of compliance  
- Audit receipts, telemetry, and anchoring records  
- Revoke licenses upon breach of LEI = 1, statutory hierarchy, or audit refusal  
- Publicly invalidate false compliance claims

Licenses are conditional, revocable, and non-transferable unless explicitly stated.

---

## 7. Supremacy and Non-Waiver

This Charter supersedes any conflicting interpretation, integration guide, or third-party framework claiming compatibility.

Failure to enforce any provision does not constitute waiver.

---

## 8. Governing Authority

This Charter is issued under the sole authority of:

**Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)**
