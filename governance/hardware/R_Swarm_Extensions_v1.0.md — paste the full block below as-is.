version: 1.0  
date_utc: 2025-12-02  
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  

scope: |
  Swarm extensions specification for TruthSeal Robotics Profile TS-R2 (swarm / fleet).
  This document defines how multiple TruthSeal-compatible robots act together as a
  coherent swarm under Traykov laws, metrics, and receipts. It builds on:
    - TS-R Cherry Checklist v1.0,
    - TS-R Failure Modes & Fallback Law v1.0,
    - TS-R Receipt Schema v1.0,
    - TS-R Human Mandate Layer v1.0.

  Audience: engineers, auditors, partners, and regulators.

## 0. Core Concepts (acronyms expanded once)

- **Aim Coherence Score (ACS)** – 0–1 metric that measures how well actions follow
  the declared aim and safety constraints over time.

- **Traykov Coherence Score v0.1 (TCS v0.1)** – 0–1 metric for overall intelligence
  coherence (truthfulness, post-quantum security strength, long-horizon self-consistency).

- **Coherence Score (CHS)** – four-band status indicator used on devices:
  - CHS/L – Low (Red)
  - CHS/M – Medium (Yellow)
  - CHS/H – High (Green)
  - CHS/UH – Ultra High (Blue)

- **Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence (TQC)** – hardware-anchored law that demands
  non-degrading coherence behaviour over time; no “free lunch” in risk.

- **Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1)** – law that forbids downgrading to
  worse, riskier states once a safer, more coherent option exists.

- **TS-R1** – TruthSeal Robotics profile for a single robot.

- **TS-R2** – TruthSeal Robotics profile for a swarm / fleet of robots that must act
  together under a shared law, metric, and receipt regime.

- **ULLI** – TruthSeal governing proof mandate with:
  - Academic Authority Proof,
  - Technical Immutability Proof,
  - Live Measurability Proof.

## 1. Purpose and Position in the Stack

TruthSeal Robotics profile **TS-R2** extends TS-R1 from “one robot” to **swarm /
fleet behaviour**. It answers:

- How a group of robots shares **Aim Coherence Score (ACS)**,  
  **Traykov Coherence Score (TCS v0.1)**, and **Coherence Score (CHS)**.
- How LEI = 1 and TQC apply when multiple robots act together.
- How receipts, anchors, and Failure Modes & Fallback Law apply at **swarm level**.
- How human authority and the Human Mandate Layer control fleets, not just single units.

TS-R2 is used when:

- multiple robots perform a joint task (e.g., warehouse, factory, logistics, public space),
- a fleet must obey shared CHS rules (e.g., city cleaners, delivery fleet),
- regulators, insurers, or owners need **fleet-level receipts and evidence**.

---

## 2. Swarm Model and Roles

### 2.1 Swarm Entities

TS-R2 uses the following basic entities:

- **Node** – a single TS-R1-compliant robot with its own ACS, TCS v0.1, CHS, and receipts.
- **Swarm** – a set of Nodes operating under a shared Aim, Law set, and Human Mandate Layer.
- **Swarm Controller** – logical coordination point (may be distributed) that:
  - aggregates metrics,
  - enforces swarm-level CHS rules,
  - manages receipts and anchoring.
- **Fleet Operator** – human role (from Human Mandate Layer) authorised to command the swarm
  within the allowed CHS and law constraints.

### 2.2 Relationship to TS-R1

- Every Node MUST independently satisfy TS-R1 checklist, Failure Modes & Fallback Law,
  Human Mandate Layer, and Receipt Schema.
- TS-R2 **never weakens** TS-R1 obligations; it only adds:
  - swarm-level rules,
  - shared CHS behaviour,
  - swarm receipts and evidence.

If there is a conflict between “single-robot safety” and “swarm goal”, **single-robot
safety wins** and must be logged.

---

## 3. Swarm-Level Metrics and CHS Behaviour

### 3.1 Swarm ACS and TCS v0.1 (conceptual)

- **Swarm ACS** – conceptual metric summarising how well the swarm’s combined actions
  follow the shared declared aim and safety constraints over time.
- **Swarm TCS v0.1** – conceptual measure of overall swarm intelligence coherence
  (communications, shared plans, and combined outputs).

Exact formulas and thresholds for swarm ACS and swarm TCS v0.1 live in the metrics
specifications and are out of scope for this document. This document assumes that
those metrics exist and are exposed to TS-R2.

### 3.2 Effective Swarm CHS Band

For safety, TS-R2 defines the **effective swarm CHS band** as:

> **Effective_CHS(swarm) = conservative function over member CHS values,  
> default: “worst-node wins” (minimum band).**

Example (worst-node policy):

- If any Node is CHS/L (Red), the entire swarm is treated as CHS/L.
- If no Node is CHS/L but at least one is CHS/M, swarm is CHS/M.
- Only if all Nodes are CHS/H or CHS/UH may the swarm operate at CHS/H or CHS/UH.

Implementations MAY use more advanced mappings (e.g., weighting by role), but:
- they MUST be at least as conservative as the worst-node rule,
- they MUST be documented and auditable.

### 3.3 Swarm Behaviour per CHS Band (summary)

- **Swarm CHS/UH (Blue)** – normal autonomous operation allowed for authorised tasks,
  subject to TS-R Cherry Checklist, Human Mandate Layer, and robotics safety bundle
  (e.g., no alcohol or cigarette purchases, no political slogans, no underage commands).
- **Swarm CHS/H (Green)** – normal operations with additional checks for high-risk tasks
  (money movement, heavy equipment, critical infrastructure).
- **Swarm CHS/M (Yellow)** – **assist-only**: swarm may sense, analyse, and advise, but
  irreversible or high-risk actions are blocked or downgraded to TS-R1 local control.
- **Swarm CHS/L (Red)** – **immediate safe-stop behaviour** at swarm level:
  - halt or retreat to predefined safe configurations,
  - notify Owner / Guardian and Fleet Operator,
  - generate Failure Modes & Fallback Law receipts.

## 4. Coordination, Quorum, and Split-Brain Handling

### 4.1 Swarm Quorum

TS-R2 requires a **quorum rule** before executing coordinated actions:

- Swarm Controller MUST verify that:
  - a sufficient fraction of Nodes are reachable,  
  - their CHS bands are acceptable for the task,  
  - their clocks / ledgers are within tolerance.  

Typical examples (configurable):

- Simple quorum: at least 2/3 of Nodes in CHS/H or CHS/UH for the task class.
- Critical quorum: 100 % of participating Nodes in CHS/H or CHS/UH for safety-critical tasks.

Quorum rules MUST be:

- documented,
- versioned,
- auditable via receipts.

### 4.2 Split-Brain Situations

Split-brain = parts of the swarm disagree on:

- law state (e.g., different ULIC / EVL versions),
- CHS interpretations,
- human authority or command state.

TS-R2 requires that:

- split-brain detection logic be implemented at Swarm Controller level, and
- in case of suspected split-brain:
  - the swarm MUST degrade to safe sub-swarms or TS-R1 local behaviour,
  - high-risk tasks MUST be suspended,
  - receipts MUST record:
    - detected condition,
    - nodes affected,
    - fallback actions taken.

No attempt to “force consensus” is allowed if it would violate LEI = 1 or TQC.

## 5. Swarm Receipts and Evidence

### 5.1 Swarm Receipt Structure

TS-R2 extends the generic TruthSeal receipt schema `ts.receipt.v1` and TS-R Receipt
Schema v1.0 with swarm fields such as:

- `swarm_id` – stable identifier for the swarm or fleet.
- `swarm_config_hash` – hash of swarm configuration (roles, quorum rules, CHS policy).
- `node_receipts` – references (or hashes) of the individual TS-R1 receipts for
  all participating Nodes.
- `effective_chs_band` – CHS/L, CHS/M, CHS/H, or CHS/UH at the time of the action.
- `swarm_quorum_rule` – identifier of the quorum rule version used.
- `swarm_fallback_state` – if any fallback path was activated.

Exact JSON schema details live in `governance/hardware/TS-R_Receipt_Schema_v1.0.md`.

### 5.2 Anchoring and Evidence

Swarm receipts:

- MUST be anchorable using the same mechanisms as single-robot receipts
  (e.g., OpenTimestamps or equivalent),
- SHOULD be used in:
  - regulator-facing reports,
  - insurer risk assessments,
  - post-incident investigations.

Where anchoring services are temporarily unavailable:

- swarm receipts MUST be produced with a **pending** anchor status,
- later anchoring MUST update the corresponding ledger entries without altering
  the original payload.

## 6. Safety Rules for Swarm Actions (TS-R2 Overlay)

TS-R2 inherits all safety rules from:

- TS-R Failure Modes & Fallback Law v1.0,
- TS-R Human Mandate Layer v1.0,
- robotics safety bundle (e.g., no autonomous buying/selling, no political slogans,
  no unsafe operation around children, infants, animals, or water).

Swarm-specific overlays include:

1. **Underage commands**  
   - Swarms MUST treat commands from underage persons as **untrusted**.  
   - At most, CHS/M assist behaviour is allowed (e.g., “I cannot do that; please ask an adult.”).

2. **Money and property**  
   - Swarms MUST NOT autonomously buy or sell items (including alcohol, cigarettes, valuables).  
   - Any interaction with high-value items (e.g., jewellery, access to safes) MUST:
     - be authorised by an appropriate human role from the Human Mandate Layer, and
     - be fully logged with TS-R receipts.

3. **Interaction with unknown humans**  
   - Swarms MUST NOT accept goods from unknown persons for relay to the Owner or Authority.  
   - Delivery / pickup interactions MUST respect the Human Mandate Layer (owner codes, SMS
     confirmation, serial-range checks).

4. **Children, infants, and vulnerable persons**  
   - Swarms MUST NOT be left alone in high-actuation modes with infants or young children.  
   - When the environment is recognised as “children only”, the default is:
     - CHS/M assist-only, or
     - safe-stop with notification to Owner / Guardian.

5. **Environment and conditions**  
   - Swarms MUST obey environment constraints from TS-R Failure Modes & Fallback Law:
     - rain, water, storms, unsafe terrain → degrade CHS and move to safe states,
     - gas / fire / leak detection → notify Owner first, then emergency services according
       to jurisdiction and configuration.

All swarm safety decisions MUST be reflected both in Node receipts and the swarm-level
receipt.

## 7. Implementation Notes and Roadmap

Implementation notes:

- TS-R2 is a **profile**, not a specific product. Vendors MUST:
  - implement TS-R1 fully at Node level,
  - implement TS-R2 swarm rules in controllers and fleet management software,
  - surface CHS bands to humans with clear, colour-coded indicators.

- Swarm dashboards SHOULD:
  - show distributions of ACS, TCS v0.1, and CHS across the fleet,
  - highlight nodes driving the effective CHS band down,
  - link directly to receipts for investigation.

Roadmap (non-normative):

- v1.x – finalise:
  - precise swarm ACS / TCS v0.1 formulas,
  - reference CHS aggregation functions,
  - example swarm receipt payloads.

- Later versions – extend to:
  - inter-fleet coordination rules,
  - cross-vendor swarm interoperability under TruthSeal laws,
  - economic incentives tied to the TS-R Economic Impact Note.

This document is the v1.0 baseline for TS-R2 swarm behaviour. Any change to these
rules MUST be versioned here and reflected in TS-R Cherry Checklist, TS-R Executive
Digest, TS-R Economic Impact Note, and TS-R receipt tooling.

## 8. TS-R2 Swarm Quick Checklist

Before shipping or certifying any TS-R2 swarm deployment, confirm:

- [ ] **TS-R1 compliance per node** – every robot in the swarm passes TS-R1 Cherry Checklist,
      Failure Modes & Fallback Law, Human Mandate Layer, and Receipt Schema.
- [ ] **Conservative CHS policy** – swarm Coherence Score (CHS) aggregation rule is documented,
      at least as strict as “worst-node wins”, and wired into controllers and dashboards.
- [ ] **Quorum rules** – swarm quorum rule(s) are written, versioned, tested, and visible in
      configuration (`swarm_quorum_rule` field in receipts).
- [ ] **Split-brain handling** – detection logic is implemented, with safe degradation to
      sub-swarms or TS-R1 behaviour and corresponding receipts.
- [ ] **Swarm receipts** – `ts.receipt.v1` + TS-R swarm fields (swarm_id, swarm_config_hash,
      node_receipts, effective_chs_band, swarm_fallback_state) are generated for critical actions.
- [ ] **Anchoring path** – anchoring of swarm receipts (e.g., OpenTimestamps) is tested,
      including the “pending → anchored” update path in ledgers.
- [ ] **Human Mandate Layer** – fleet operator, owner/guardian, and regulator-facing roles
      are configured; authority limits and override rules are documented.

This checklist is non-exhaustive but MUST be satisfied for any TS-R2 deployment that
claims TruthSeal compliance.
