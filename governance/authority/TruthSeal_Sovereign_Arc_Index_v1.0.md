## 0. Purpose of this Document

This file defines the **constitutional order, authority hierarchy, and dependency graph**
of the TruthSeal™ ecosystem.

It is the **single source of truth** that governs:
- what comes first,
- what depends on what,
- what may be public,
- what must remain sovereign or Doctorantura-only.

No technical implementation, product copy, or partnership document
may contradict this index.

## 1. The Sovereign Arc (Definition)

The **TruthSeal Sovereign Arc** is the end-to-end system that:
- defines lawful behavior for AI and AGI,
- enforces that behavior through irreversible constraints,
- measures coherence continuously,
- records evidence immutably,
- and returns accountability to human institutions.

The Arc is **law → enforcement → measurement → receipt → liability**.

---

## 2. Order of Authority (Non-Negotiable)

The following order is strict and irreversible:

### (1) ULLI — Universal Law of Life & Information  
**Type:** Foundational principle  
**Role:** Establishes that information integrity and system stability are inseparable.  
**Notes:**  
- Not a hardware block  
- Not a metric  
- Governs all downstream laws and designs

---

### (2) TQC — Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence  
**Type:** Governing law  
**Role:** Requires non-degrading coherence over time in intelligent systems.  
**Notes:**  
- Applies to classical, hybrid, and quantum-adjacent systems  
- Defines the need for enforcement, not detection

---

### (3) LEI = 1 — Law of Ethical Irreversibility  
**Type:** Constant  
**Role:** Once a safer, more coherent path is known, regression is forbidden.  
**Notes:**  
- Must be enforced structurally (hardware or equivalent authority)  
- No rollback language permitted anywhere in the stack

---

### (4) Coherence Metrics (Measurement Layer)

Metrics do not define the law; they **measure compliance with it**.

#### 4.1 TCS — Traykov Coherence Score (v0.1)  
- Global intelligence coherence  
- Truthfulness, security strength, long-horizon consistency

#### 4.2 ACS — Aim Coherence Score  
- Execution-path coherence relative to declared aims  
- Used for gating, receipts, and fiduciary disclosure

#### 4.3 CHS — Coherence Health Score  
- Operational safety bands  
- Primary metric for robotics and embodied systems

---

### (5) Hardware Law Profiles (Enforcement Layer)

These profiles implement the laws and metrics in real systems.

#### TS-A1  
- Accelerator / GPU / DPU governance profile  
- Data centres, cloud, high-risk AI infrastructure

#### TS-R1  
- Single-robot governance profile (humanoid or autonomous unit)

#### TS-R2  
- Swarm / fleet / distributed robotic systems  
- Includes drones, underwater systems, industrial collectives

---

### (6) Receipts & Ledgers (Evidence Layer)

All enforcement actions must emit verifiable evidence.

- **Receipts:** cryptographically signed, machine-verifiable records  
- **ULIC:** Universal Law registry reference  
- **EVL:** Epoch Verification Ledger  
- **Integrity Manifest:** composite proof map  
- **QENC:** Quantum Ecosystem Closure ProofCapsule  
- **Anchoring:** OpenTimestamps / equivalent public time services

---

### (7) Execution & Partnerships (Derivative Layer)

All partnerships (e.g. NVIDIA) are **implementations**, not sources of authority.

- Partners adopt TruthSeal law and metrics
- Partners do not redefine ULLI, TQC, LEI, ACS, or CHS
- Partner documents must reference this index explicitly

---

## 3. Classification Rules

| Layer | Visibility |
|------|-----------|
| ULLI / TQC / LEI (names only) | Public allowed |
| Metrics (conceptual) | Public / Partner |
| Enforcement mechanics | Partner / Internal |
| Robotics safety law | Partner / Regulator |
| Ledger internals | Internal |
| Doctorantura doctrine | Doctorantura-only |

---

## 4. Conflict Resolution Rule

If any document conflicts with this index:
1. This index prevails.
2. The conflicting document must be revised or withdrawn.
3. No exception applies, including executive decks or partner briefs.

---

## 5. Change Control

- This file changes only by explicit sovereign decision.
- All changes must be versioned and timestamped.
- No silent edits permitted.
