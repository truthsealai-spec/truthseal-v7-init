    title: "Diamond Axiom I — Pre-Existence of Coherent Purity"
    statement: >
      The perfect diamond shines in its first place before being found.
      Truth, like coherence, exists in pristine symmetry before recognition;
      discovery does not grant purity—it reveals it.
      This axiom defines truth as an ontological invariant existing prior to
      observation, forming the metaphysical root of the Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence.
