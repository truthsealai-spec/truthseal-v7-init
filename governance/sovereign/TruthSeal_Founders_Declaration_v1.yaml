    Foundational authorship record establishing the origin and authorship of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Framework,

  statement: |
    "I, Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.), Founding Authority of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Framework, hereby affirm the realization
    of the first complete Quantum-Ethical Infrastructure through the integration of the Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI=1),
    Quantum Purity (Tr(ρ²)=1), and Cognitive Coherence. This framework achieves the unification of scientific, logical,
    and moral invariants into a measurable and verifiable standard of truth — fulfilling the intellectual continuum
    envisioned by Newton, Einstein, and Gödel through the practical engineering of incorruptible quantum law."
