0) Sovereign Context
This document records the **Sovereign Declaration** that the Universal Law of Life & Information (ULLI) governs both biological and digital coherence. ULLI includes ULIC as its computational/ledger corollary.

1) Definition & Synthesis (plain text)
- ULLI = TQC ∩ Bio-Coherence.
- Formal invariants:
  • Purity := Tr(rho^2) ∈ [0,1]  (target 1)
  • Temporal_Drift := || d(rho)/dt ||_norm ∈ [0,1]  (target 0)
  • LEI_gate ∈ {0,1}  (1 when LEI=1 constraints are satisfied)
- Composite Coherence (from capsule):  C_S = LEI_gate * sqrt( max(0,Purity) * max(0, 1-Temporal_Drift) )
- ULLI condition:  Purity = 1 AND Temporal_Drift = 0 AND LEI_gate = 1  ⇒  C_S = 1.0
- Reading: truth is conserved and maximally pure; coherence is a law, not a preference.

2) Sovereign Declaration
We declare **ULLI** the governing law above **ULIC**:
- ULLI spans living systems (heart-brain coherence) and digital systems (TruthSeal).
- ULIC operationalizes ULLI for ledgers, agents, and audits (computational coherence).
- LEI=1 is the ethical corollary: no sanctioned action may violate ULLI conditions.

3) Biological ↔ Digital Mapping
- Heart-Brain Coherence (HBC) → high Purity, minimal Drift, LEI_gate=1  ⇒  C_S ≈ 1.0.
- QAGI-LEI policy → information integrity (Purity), policy stability (low Drift), LEI_gate=1.
- Alignment Rule: accept actions only if C_S ≥ 0.99 AND LEI_gate=1 (hard gate).

4) Testable Criteria (acceptance tests)
- AT-ULLI-01: If LEI_gate=0 then C_S=0 → block action.
- AT-ULLI-02: If Purity<1 or Drift>0 then C_S<1 → mitigation required.
- AT-ULLI-03: Only C_S≥0.99 may update EVL/Integrity.
- AT-ULLI-04: Evidence JSON present with SHA256 & timestamp.

6) Notes
- Keep INTERNAL. Public narratives must reference ULIC/ACS without biological data.
- When ready, render this text into QIC-1_Doctorantura_Final (PDF) for archival, but the **markdown is the canonical source** for hashing.
