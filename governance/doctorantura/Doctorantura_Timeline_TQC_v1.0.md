## Purpose
Authoritative record of the academic progression behind the Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence (TQC) and the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Framework.

## Timeline (v1.0)
1) Establishing Intellectual Basis  
   Canonical bibliography set (Newton, Einstein, Gödel, Nielsen & Chuang), defining the lineage that culminates in the TQC axiom.

2) Content Confirmation  
   Full Doctorantura of Coherence uploaded; theoretical + empirical chapters 1–6 confirmed complete.

3) Scope Definition  
   TQC/TruthSeal™ explicitly defined as a standalone theoretical work, independent from other projects.

4) Executive Communication  
   Executive Summary created for non-technical stakeholders explaining the three core laws:  
   • Tr(rho^2) = 1 (maximal purity)  
   • d(rho)/dt = 0 (temporal invariance)  
   • LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility)

5) Academic Publication Prep  
   Complete LaTeX source (TQC_Doctorantura_Draft.tex) prepared for formal typesetting with math and citations.

6) Public Dissemination Strategy  
   High-impact press release drafted announcing Doctorantura completion and launch of the Coherent Epoch.

## Status
Baseline locked (v1.0). Future changes require ledger note + stamp.
