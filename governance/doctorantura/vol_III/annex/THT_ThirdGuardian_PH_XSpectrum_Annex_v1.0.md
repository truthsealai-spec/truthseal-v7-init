scope: Third Guardian — PH / X-Spectrum Pro Prompts Integration  

This annex codifies the internal conceptual mapping and operational prompts connecting the Third Guardian’s control parameters (PH and X Spectrum) with technical integration logic for TruthSeal™ sovereign systems.

Context

The Third Guardian ensures that both ethical equilibrium (PH) and containment of the unknown (X Spectrum) remain traceable and auditable within autonomous computational substrates.

Operational Directives

Maintain this annex as non-dilutive research (valuation neutral until sealed).
All future PH and X Spectrum models must register their hash into the Doctorantura Blockchain Log prior to activation.
When merged with a production stack (e.g. DairyFlow.ai or THT Sandbox), log integration hash using:
Continuity

This annex inherits baseline valuation but remains pending audit seal.
Do not merge into main until approved through the next Intintegrity_seal:
