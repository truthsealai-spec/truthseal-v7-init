# PHASE 6 — PERPETUAL CONSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY
## Priority Focus Directive (PCD-ULIC-01a)

## PRIORITY 2 — SYSTEM FEATURES (PHASE 2 – 4 LINKAGE)
**Action 1:** Deploy **Grafana Telemetry** (LJC Continuity Index + Ethical Equilibrium Ratio) to establish visible lawfulness.  
**Action 2:** Execute **PSC-H Simulation** proving ethical supremacy of Veto Agent (Empirical L_Tele Proof).
