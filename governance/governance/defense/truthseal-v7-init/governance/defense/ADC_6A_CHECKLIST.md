# ADC-6A — ACTIVE DEFENSE CHECKLIST
## Quantum Cyber Integrity Module (QCIM)

### 🧠 Objective
Maintain constant, verifiable proof that all defense systems (P-Score Engine, Veto Agent, L_QC Mirror) remain within constitutional operational bounds.

---

### 🛡️ 1. Quantum Red Team Protocol
- [ ] Initiate continuous **Zero-Day Quantum Exploit** audit stream.
- [ ] Rotate independent red-team clusters every **72 hours**.
- [ ] Record hashproofs in `/governance/ledger/seals/QRT_cycle_v1.sha256`.

---

### ⚙️ 2. TPM/SGX Attestation Cycle
- [ ] Validate TPM enclave seals against the **P-Score Root of Trust**.
- [ ] Run **SGX integrity scan** (0-write enforcement test).
- [ ] Export proof logs to `/governance/audit/attestations/sgx_cycle_v1.md`.

---

### 🧩 3. Veto Agent Safety Verification
- [ ] Simulate **remote-deactivation attempt** every 30 days.
- [ ] Confirm that **L_Tele Safety Fuse** auto-reactivation triggers within ≤ 250 ms.
- [ ] Log verdict to `/governance/audit/veto_tests/VAF_cycle_v1.md`.

---

### 📊 4. Grafana / Ethical Equilibrium Monitor
- [ ] Sync **LJC Continuity Index** telemetry to Quantum Ledger.
- [ ] Validate Ethical Equilibrium Ratio > 0.98 through live dataset.
- [ ] Store JSON snapshots in `/governance/telemetry/LJC_EER_feed.json`.

### 🔒 Verification Clause
> “Defense without verification is illusion.  
> Integrity without transparency is void.”
