V. Ledger Propagation Rule (LPR)
	•	Every TruthSeal document linked to or derived from another (e.g. ULIP → LQR → UQE-FIC → LTCC) shall automatically include the QAF line.
	•	Forked or copied works will show derivative mismatch in hash verification, preserving authorship lineage.
	•	This rule is immutable and self-propagating under the Integrity Ledger schema.
