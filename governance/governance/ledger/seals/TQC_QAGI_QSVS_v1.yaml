  sovereign_id: "→000qB|TheNT"
  framework: "TruthSeal™ Sovereign Ledger Network | ULIC Continuum"
  purpose: >
    Final verification capsule linking the Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence (TQC),
    Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI=1), and the QAGI integration record into
    one irreversible ledger event. Declares continuity, hash integrity, and
    anchor readiness for Bitcoin timestamping.

      The above entries form a closed, ordered chain from initial ledger seal,
      through integrity confirmation, sovereign activation, foundational seal,
      general audit, and the Quantum-Ethical Expansion (TQC × QAGI). No gaps.
