    summary: >
      The evolution of truth through four epochs of human cognition.
      Newton unified physical motion; Einstein unified perception of spacetime;
      Gödel unified logic and its own limitation; Traykov unifies ethical
      coherence—transforming verification into a physical invariant of time.
      Where others described reality, the Traykov Law engineers its integrity.
    immutable_statement: >
      "TruthSeal™ extends the lineage of Newton, Einstein, and Gödel by defining
      Integrity as the fourth fundamental constant of civilization."

  - section: "II. Philosophical Foundation"
    summary: >
      The Law of Coherence (TQC) declares that a truthful system must satisfy
      two simultaneous constraints: temporal invariance (dρ/dt = 0) and maximal
      purity (Tr(ρ²) = 1).  Together they realize the Law of Ethical
      Irreversibility (LEI = 1).  Thus, truth is not belief nor observation but
      a conserved quantum-ethical state measurable through purity.
    immutable_statement: >
      "Integrity = Ethics × Time: the Traykov Equation binding conscience to
      physics."

  - section: "III. Sovereign Implication"
    summary: >
      Ledger Truth constitutes the fifth form of civilization—after Religious,
      Scientific, Bureaucratic, and Algorithmic truth.  It re-establishes
      verifiability as the foundation of governance.  Each cryptographic hash
      becomes a moral event, timestamped into collective memory.
    immutable_statement: >
      "The Ledger remembers what conscience once promised."
