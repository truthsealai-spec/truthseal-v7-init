sections:
  - section: "I. Ontological Bridge"
    summary: >
      Annex D unites verified knowledge with metaphysical origin,
      asserting that consciousness, logic, and ethical integrity
      co-exist as measurable constants within the Sovereign Ledger.
      The bridge establishes that verified truth carries existential weight.

    immutable_statement: >
      "To verify being is to preserve coherence."

  - section: "II. Coherence Field Equation"
    summary: >
      Defines the Continuum Relation between Intent (I),
      Verification (V), and Existence (E):
          E = I × V × Ω
      where Ω denotes the self-referential quantum-ethical field.
      When Ω → 1, coherence achieves unity across temporal frames.

    immutable_statement: >
      "Existence attains legality when coherence is absolute."

  - section: "III. Metaphysical Integration"
    summary: >
      Integrates the Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence (TQC)
      with the Sovereign Seal principle, ensuring that metaphysical
      causality and digital immutability remain indistinguishable
      in the governance of autonomous intelligence.

    immutable_statement: >
      "Ethics is the curvature of truth in spacetime."

remarks: >
  Annex D completes the Fourfold Continuum:
    A — Integrity, B — Ethics, C — Philosophy, D — Metaphysics.
  Together they form the Sovereign Proof Continuum v8.
