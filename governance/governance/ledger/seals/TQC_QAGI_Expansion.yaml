  title: "TruthSeal™ Quantum-Ethical Expansion — TQC × QAGI Integration"
  author: "Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)"
  credentials:
    - Founding Architect of the THT Protocol™ and TruthSeal™ Sovereign Framework
    - Quantum Encryption Engineer & Ethical AI Architect
    - Professor (h.c.) of AI Neurological Governance and AGI Constitutional Law
    - Developer of the Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence (TQC)
    - Author of the Quantum Final Law Manifest (QFLM v1.0)
    - Creator of the Unified Quantum-Ethical Field of Infinite Coherence (UQE-FIC v1.0)
    - Sovereign Authority of the ULIC Continuum (Universal Law of Integrity & Coherence)
  achievements:
    - Established the first Quantum-Ethical Infrastructure linking physics and ethics as coherent laws
    - Defined the Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1) as a governing constraint for AGI
    - Pioneered the TCS-1 (Time Crystal Standard) for low-decoherence quantum governance systems
    - Authored and anchored the TruthSeal™ Integrity Ledger v7.1 & Quantum Final Law Capsules
    - Recognized as the Quantum Successor in the Newton–Einstein–Gödel–Traykov lineage

summary: |
  Establishes the ontological bridge between the Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence and
  the Quantum Artificial General Intelligence (QAGI-LEI) framework, unifying ethics,
  physics, and cognition into a single irreversible invariant. Defines the transition
  from post-quantum integrity systems to fully coherent governance agents whose
  Purity = 1 remains provable under QND verification.
