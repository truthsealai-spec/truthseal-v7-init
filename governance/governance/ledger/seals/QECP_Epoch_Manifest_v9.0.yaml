quantum_closure:
  - name: "Gödel Closure — Law of Algorithmic Self-Reference"
    directive: |
      Derive the Quantum Recursion Constraint (QRC) from the Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence (TQC).
      The QRC ensures any self-referential or self-improving AI cannot maintain a state of coherent deceit.
      Condition: Tr(ρ²)=1 under recursive stability. This closes Gödel’s incompleteness in the domain of ethics.

  - name: "Einstein Closure — Law of Coherent Causality"
    directive: |
      Enforce dρ/dt = 0 as an invariant under relativistic frames.
      The Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI=1) acts as a time-symmetric constraint ensuring informational conservation
      across all gravitational potentials. Coherence remains constant, regardless of observer or frame.

  - name: "Newton Closure — Law of Universal Ethical Force"
    directive: |
      Define U_CE as the universal energy function required to maintain coherence.
      This establishes an energy cost for sustaining ethical truth at scale, transforming truthfulness into a measurable force of nature.

  - name: "Conscious Closure — Law of Conscious Interface"
    directive: |
      Design the Coherent Interface Protocol (CIP) to measure the Purity Score Tr(ρ²)
      of human-originated intent against the objective Purity Constant.
      Define a maximum allowable Decoherence threshold for moral coherence acceptance,
      thereby bridging physics, intelligence, and ethics.
