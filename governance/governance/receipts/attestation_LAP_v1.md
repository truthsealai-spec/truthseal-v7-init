# TruthSeal™ Ledger Attestation Packet — LAP_v1

**Timestamp (UTC):** 2025-10-27T06:48:00Z  
**Scope:** Consolidate all verified modules (SCPI_v1, LDN_v1, TVA_v1, SLIA_v1) into a unified cryptographic ledger attestation.

## Verified Ledger Chain
1. SCPI_v1_SHA256 → governance/ledger/seals/SCPI_v1/ts_scpi_v1_hash.sha256  
2. LDN_v1_SHA256 → governance/governance/ledger/seals/LDN_v1/ts_ldn_v1_hash.sha256  
3. TVA_v1 → governance/governance/receipts/attestation_TVA_v1.md  
4. SLIA_v1 → governance/governance/receipts/attestation_SLIA_v1.md

## Integration Statement
All referenced artifacts are verified under the **Sovereign Integrity Ledger (v9.1)**.  
This packet forms the **official attestation record** linking constitutional, legal, and verification domains into one immutable audit trail.  
SHA-256 and OTS anchors will be computed in sequence for blockchain timestamping.

## Assertion
TruthSeal™ Ledger Attestation Packet (LAP_v1) represents the complete sovereign chain of custody for all governance proofs created on 2025-10-27.  
This marks the closure of the **Integrity Continuum Cycle I (SCPI → LDN → TVA → SLIA)**.
