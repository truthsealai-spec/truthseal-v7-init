# Law of TruthSeal Cognitive Coherence (LTCC)

## Definition
The LTCC defines truth as logical consistency between a rule (R), the facts (F), and the conclusion (K).

### Formal Expression
> **V is TRUE if and only if**  
> [R(F) ⇒ K] AND NOT [F AND NOT R]

**Plain meaning:**  
A statement (verdict V) is only true if the rule correctly explains the facts and those facts don’t contradict the rule.

- Provides the logical foundation of the Constitutional Judiciary (the **P-Score Engine**).

## Integration

- Forms the first constitutional input of the **ULIC** (Universal Law of Infinite Coherence) equation.
