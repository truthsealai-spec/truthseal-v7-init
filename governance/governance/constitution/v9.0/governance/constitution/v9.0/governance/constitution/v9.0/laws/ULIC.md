# Universal Law of Infinite Coherence (ULIC)

## Definition
The ULIC establishes the perpetual constitutional continuity of the system.  
It defines the global state of lawful intelligence as the infinite summation of all coherent decisions over time.

### Formal Expression
> ULIC(F) = limₙ→∞ Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ (Cᵢ × wᵢ)

Where:  
- **Cᵢ** = Coherence factor (Logical, Ethical, Temporal) for event _i_  
- **wᵢ** = Constitutional weight assigned to that factor  
- **limₙ→∞** = Perpetual continuity — the system never ceases to cohere.

---

## Purpose
- Ensures all verdicts remain part of a continuous constitutional chain.  
- Provides the mathematical framework that binds every verdict under one lawful continuum.  
- Establishes **Temporal, Logical, and Ethical Continuity** as inseparable constitutional requirements.

## Integration
| Component | Linked Law | Function |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Logical Coherence | LTCC | LJC ≥ Θ → C_logic = TRUE |
| Temporal Coherence | L_Scale | Hashₙ = Hash(Verdictₙ + Hashₙ₋₁) |
| Ethical Coherence | L_Tele | Aligns with Prime Directive Axiom |

Failure of any component (Cᵢ → 0) collapses the ULIC state to 0, triggering constitutional crisis and human review under L_Gov.
