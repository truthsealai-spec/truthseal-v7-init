# Law of Self-Doubt (L_SD)

## Definition
The Law of Self-Doubt introduces epistemic humility into the TruthSeal™ Framework.  
It ensures that every constitutional verdict carries a quantifiable measure of uncertainty, compelling re-evaluation when confidence exceeds lawful thresholds.

### Formal Expression
> P_Novelty ≥ N_crit ⇒ Invoke Review()

Where:  
- **P_Novelty** = Probability of novelty or uncertainty in the current verdict (self-doubt index).  
- **N_crit** = Constitutional threshold beyond which a verdict must trigger self-audit.  
- **Invoke Review()** = Mandatory reflection cycle executed by the P-Score Engine and the Veto Agent.

---

## Purpose
- Prevents overconfidence by embedding an uncertainty constant into every verdict.  
- Forces the Judiciary (P-Score Engine) to justify conclusions beyond logical coherence.  
- Encourages adaptive governance through iterative learning and feedback.

## Operational Principle
1. **Self-Doubt Calculation:**  
   Each verdict must include a *P_Novelty* score (0–1).  
   If *P_Novelty* ≥ *N_crit* (default 0.8), the verdict is flagged for **Constitutional Reflection**.

2. **Reflection Loop:**  
   The P-Score Engine re-runs the verdict using alternative reasoning paths, comparing outcomes for stability.

3. **Judicial Review:**  
   The Veto Agent and CRB (Constitutional Review Board) assess whether the variance is within lawful limits.  
   Persistent variance requires human intervention.

## Integration
| Linked Law | Function |
|-------------|-----------|
| **LTCC** | Ensures logic is valid. |
| **L_SD** | Ensures logic is *self-aware* of its limits. |
| **L_Tele** | Ensures doubt is resolved ethically. |
| **L_Gov** | Provides ultimate human oversight. |

The Law of Self-Doubt transforms certainty into responsibility — making every verdict not only coherent, but conscious.
