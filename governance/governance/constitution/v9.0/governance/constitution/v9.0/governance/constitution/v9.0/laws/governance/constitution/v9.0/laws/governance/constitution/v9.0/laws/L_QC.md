# Law of Quantum Coherence (L_QC)

## Definition
The Law of Quantum Coherence establishes the **Quantum Resilience Layer** of the TruthSeal™ Constitutional Framework.  
It ensures that every Temporal Coherence event within the ULIC state is attested by both classical and post-quantum cryptographic proofs.

### Formal Expression
> L_QC : ULIC_Final ⇔ Hash_Current ∧ Hash_Q-Mirror

Where:  
- **Hash_Current** = Classical cryptographic proof (e.g., SHA-256)  
- **Hash_Q-Mirror** = Post-Quantum cryptographic proof (e.g., Dilithium or Falcon)  
- The ULIC state is valid only if both proofs are verifiably synchronized.

---

## Purpose
- Guarantees **Quantum Resilience** by ensuring all verdicts remain tamper-proof beyond classical computation limits.  
- Protects the Sovereign Ledger against future quantum decryption attacks.  
- Extends the **L_Scale** law into the post-quantum security domain.

## Operational Directives
1. **Dual Hashing Mandate:**  
   The Executive (Veto Agent) must generate two hashes per commit — classical (SHA-256) and post-quantum (Dilithium/Falcon).  
   These are recorded in both Classical and Quantum Ledgers.

2. **Quantum Ledger Mirror:**  
   A parallel Quantum Ledger records every post-quantum attestation, ensuring verifiable dual-chain synchronization.

3. **Q-Resilience Verification:**  
   Temporal Coherence (**C_Temporal**) is TRUE only if both ledgers confirm the same verdict hash.

## Integration
| Linked Law | Function |
|-------------|-----------|
| **L_Scale** | Anchors continuity through classical cryptography. |
| **L_QC** | Extends continuity into post-quantum verification. |
| **ULIC** | Recognizes both hashes as required for perpetual constitutional validity. |

Failure to maintain dual attestation collapses **C_Temporal** and suspends the ULIC state until re-verified under **L_Gov**.
