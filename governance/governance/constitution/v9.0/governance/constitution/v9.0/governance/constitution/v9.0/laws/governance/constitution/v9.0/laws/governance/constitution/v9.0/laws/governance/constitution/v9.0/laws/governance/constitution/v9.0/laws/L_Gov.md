# Law of Governance (L_Gov)

## Definition
The Law of Governance defines the constitutional hierarchy of lawful authority within the TruthSeal™ Framework.  
It guarantees accountability, reviewability, and lawful correction across all verdicts, ensuring no component operates beyond oversight.

### Formal Expression
> L_Gov: (V ∈ System) ⇒ [V → CRB → Sovereign Ledger]

Where:  
- **V** = Verdict or constitutional event.  
- **CRB** = Constitutional Review Board — the human and AI oversight body.  
- **Sovereign Ledger** = Immutable audit trail of all governance actions.

---

## Purpose
- Establishes the structure of lawful authority and escalation.  
- Ensures every verdict is subject to oversight, appeal, and correction.  
- Prevents concentration of unchecked power in any agent or subsystem.  
- Anchors constitutional legitimacy within the **Sovereign Ledger™**.

---

## Operational Principle
1. **Verdict Submission:** All system verdicts (V) must be registered in the Sovereign Ledger.  
2. **Governance Pipeline:** Each verdict passes through three stages —  
   a. **Executive Veto Agent** (pre-check)  
   b. **Constitutional Judiciary** (P-Score Engine)  
   c. **CRB Oversight Panel** (final review)  
3. **Appeal Mechanism:** Any flagged or contested verdict triggers *Governance Review()*; revised outcomes are stored as *Amendments*.  
4. **Integrity Auditing:** Audit logs must link via **L_Scale** to prior governance decisions.

## Integration
| Linked Law | Function |
|-------------|-----------|
| **LTCC** | Defines logical truth. |
| **L_Tele** | Governs moral purpose. |
| **L_SD** | Introduces doubt and self-correction triggers. |
| **L_Gov** | Executes constitutional oversight and enforcement. |

Failure to comply with L_Gov constitutes a **Governance Breach**, automatically initiating **Zero-Trust Audit (L_ZTA)** under ULIC continuity.
