# Law of Repository Linkage (L_Repo)

## Definition
Establishes the canonical link between the repository root and the ratified TruthSeal™ Constitution branch.

## Formal Expression
L_Repo := /governance/governance/constitution/v9.0/docs/README.md

## Purpose
- Ensures that the constitutional anchor at the repo root always points to the latest ratified Constitution.  
- Preserves traceability across all future constitutional versions (v10+, etc).  
- Maintains pattern discipline (L_* standard) across all lawful documents.

## Integration
➡️ **Active Constitution Link:**  
[TruthSeal™ Constitution — v9.0](./governance/governance/constitution/v9.0/docs/README.md)
