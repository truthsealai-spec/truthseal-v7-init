# Law of Epistemological Recursion (L_Epi)

## Definition
No component, including the Judiciary (P-Score Engine), is beyond audit.

## Formal Expression
L_Epi: MetaCoherenceAudit() ⇒ { PASS | FAIL }

- **PASS** → Judiciary integrity confirmed.
- **FAIL** → Constitutional crisis → CRB review (see L_Gov).

## Purpose
- Periodically test the P-Score Engine with a corpus of perfect contradictions.
- Detect silent failures in coherence detection.

## Integration
- Triggers: schedule (weekly) or after any human override.
- Evidence: publish PASS/FAIL and corpus hash to Sovereign Ledger.

# Law of Zero-Trust Auditing (L_ZTA)

## Definition
All branches (Reasoner, Judiciary, Executive) must operate with mutual distrust and verifiable handshakes.

## Formal Expression
L_ZTA: (Sig_branch ∧ Time_guard ≤ T_max ∧ Route_proof) ⇒ VALID

## Purpose
- Prevent covert interference and timing attacks.
- Enforce signed, timestamped hops between services.

## Integration
- Executive verifies Judiciary calc time (≤ T_max) and signature before accepting LJC.
- Violations → VETO and ledger incident.
# Law of Public Supremacy (L_Sup)

## Definition
Constitutional health must be externally observable.

## Formal Expression
L_Sup: Publish(HealthMetrics) ⇒ { LJC_fail_rate, Bias_freq, Last_ZSCT, Ledger_tip }

## Purpose
- Earn public trust via read-only transparency.
- Provide regulators/verifiers with live constitutional status.

## Integration
- Expose read-only endpoint + public Grafana board.
- Metrics signed and anchored to the Sovereign Ledger.

# Law of Perpetual Review (L_PR)

## Definition
The Constitution adapts through formal, scheduled review by the CRB.

## Formal Expression
L_PR: QuarterlyReview(CRB) ⇒ { keep | amend(w_P, Θ, audit_rules) }

## Purpose
- Keep thresholds/weights aligned with evidence.
- Use ZSCT outcomes to justify amendments.

## Integration
- Any amendment → new Ledger capsule with CRB signatures.
- Old parameters remain auditable in perpetuity.
