# Audit v9 Backlog — Deficit Map (TruthSeal™)

## Must-have (blockers)
- [ ] Add LTCC statement file → `governance/ltcc/ltcc_axiom.md`
- [ ] Add LJC formula file (w_P largest; sum=1) → `governance/metrics/ljc_formula.md`
- [ ] Add separated engine docs:
      - `governance/engines/T_Validator.md`
      - `governance/engines/P_Score_Engine.md`
      - `governance/engines/Veto_Agent.md`
- [ ] Add ZSCT mandate → `governance/resilience/zsct_mandate.md`
- [ ] Ensure receipts exist and are named to match entry_id → `governance/ledger/receipts/`

## Nice-to-have (speed & ops)
- [ ] Normalize line endings to LF in governance/*
- [ ] Add valuation plan v9 → `governance/ledger/valuation_plan_v9.yml`
- [ ] Add offers SKUs → `go-to-market/truthseal_offers.md`
- [ ] Lock AICL hash content: Verdict + LJC + P_Score + Bias_Flag + TraceID

## Cadence
- Re-run “Audit v9 — LTCC/LJC/Receipts” after each blocker is added.
