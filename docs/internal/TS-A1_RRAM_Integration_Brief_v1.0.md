## 6) Plain-English explainer (non-technical)

- **Think of RRAM** like a race car engine: extremely fast and fuel-efficient.  
- **Think of TruthSeal (TS-A1)** like the safety system + black-box: it prevents crashes and keeps evidence.  
- If the car **wobbles** (numbers drift), TS-A1 **slows or stops it** (fail-safe).  
- Every ride (result) gets a **ticket** (receipt). When external timestamping is live, the ticket is **stamped on Bitcoin time** so nobody can fake it later.  
- Result: not just **fast answers**, but **fast answers you can prove**.
