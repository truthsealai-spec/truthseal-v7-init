# TruthSeal™ — Pre-Christmas 2025 Executive Digest v1.0

version: 1.0  
date_utc: 2025-12-02  
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  

scope: |
  Executive digest of the TruthSeal “Pre-Christmas 2025” execution queue.
  This document explains, in one place:
    - which core laws, metrics, and profiles are now locked,
    - which product and robotics specs are in place,
    - how these pieces connect into a coherent TruthSeal offer.
  It is written for executives, regulators, partners, and internal leaders
  who need a fast overview before diving into the individual specs.

## 0. Glossary — Laws, Metrics, Profiles (expanded once)

**Core laws and fields**

- **ULLI** — TruthSeal governing proof mandate:
  Academic Authority Proof, Technical Immutability Proof, Live Measurability
  Proof. (Full doctrinal expansion lives in Doctorantura.)

- **Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence (TQC)** — hardware-anchored law that
  demands non-degrading coherence behaviour over time; no “free lunch” in
  risk. Coherence must improve or remain stable under approved updates.

- **Traykov Law of Coherence v1.0 (TLC v1.0)** — law that defines how close
  a system is allowed to approach perfect coherence, and that overall
  monotonic improvement is required release by release.

- **Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1)** — law that forbids the system
  from downgrading back to a worse, riskier state once a safer, more
  coherent state has been attained.

**Core metrics**

- **Traykov Coherence Score v0.1 (TCS v0.1)** — 0–1 metric for overall
  intelligence coherence (truthfulness, post-quantum security strength,
  long-horizon self-consistency).

- **Aim Coherence Score (ACS)** — 0–1 metric that measures how well actions
  follow the declared aim and safety constraints over time.

- **Coherence Health Score (CHS)** — four-band status indicator for a robot
  or swarm:
  - **CHS/L** — Low (Red),
  - **CHS/M** — Medium (Yellow),
  - **CHS/H** — High (Green),
  - **CHS/UH** — Ultra High (Blue).

- **TCS Noise Distiller Profile (TCS-ND)** — profile that separates genuine
  signal variables from hype, distortion, or manipulation (Noise), with
  sub-scores ND01, ND02, … for different content types.

- **TCS Finance Profile (TCS-Finance)** — “Anti-Bubble / Finance Profile”
  that applies TCS v0.1 and TCS-ND to financial narratives to separate
  sober, risk-aware analysis from fear-driven or hype-driven content.

**Profiles and UX**

- **TS-R1 / TS-R2** — TruthSeal Robotics Profiles:
  TS-R1 for a single robot, TS-R2 for a swarm or fleet.

- **Devora** — TruthSeal front-end assistant / console that presents
  coherence reports and receipts to users (web and PDF).

- **Hippocrates Profile** — TruthSeal medical / clinical coherence profile
  (legal and safety details in a dedicated baseline; not a diagnostic
  service).

- **Philosophical Profiles** — first generation of TCS-based profiles
  (for example Archimedes, Aristotle, Hippocrates) that interpret TCS v0.1,
  ACS, and CHS through different philosophical lenses.

## 1. What Is Locked for Pre-Christmas 2025

The following specs are now in place and versioned:

1. **Core laws and metrics (basis for everything)**
   - ULLI, TQC, LEI = 1, TLC v1.0.
   - TCS v0.1, ACS, CHS bands (including TS-R CHS Law & Thresholds v1.0).
   - Noise Distiller Profile v0.2 (TCS-ND) and Finance Profile v0.1
     (TCS-Finance).

2. **Robotics hardware law (TS-R pack)**
   - TS-R Cherry Checklist v1.0 (baseline “must-have” items).
   - TS-R Receipt Schema v1.0 (robotics-specific extension of ts.receipt.v1).
   - TS-R Failure Modes & Fallback Law v1.0.
   - TS-R Human Mandate Layer v1.0.
   - TS-R Swarm Extensions v1.0.
   - TS-R Economic Impact Note v1.0.
   - TS-R CHS Law & Thresholds v1.0 (numeric rules for CHS/L, CHS/M,
     CHS/H, CHS/UH).
   - TS-R Executive Digest v1.0 (short overview for non-technical readers).

3. **Devora UX and reports**
   - Devora & Report UX Baseline v1.0 (standard layout and wording for
     coherence reports across Free, Pro, Enterprise, and Network plans).
   - Tightened Anti-Bubble examples and Finance profile integration in
     Devora UX.
   - Guardrails for clinical and political use (for example Hippocrates
     Profile Legal & Safety Baseline v1.0).

4. **Plans and tiers**
   - Plans and Tiers v1.0:
     - Free — limited reports, no receipts or anchoring.
     - Pro — reports + PDFs, initial receipts and anchoring.
     - Enterprise — full metrics, anchored receipts, regulator-grade flows.
     - Network / Platform — embedded deployments, robotics / TS-R options.

5. **Ledgers and anchoring (QENC path)**
   - STATUS_PreChristmas_2025_v1.0 (snapshot of which specs are DONE and
     which are next).
   - QENC Anchoring Playbook v1.0:
     - explains which artifact is anchored (QENC_v1_0_ProofCapsule.json),
     - defines allowed states (PENDING, RECEIPT_ISSUED, ANCHORED),
     - describes how to update the Integrity Manifest and status docs
       after anchoring.

Together these pieces form the **Pre-Christmas 2025 TruthSeal baseline**.

## 2. What This Enables in Practice

For executives and partners, the Pre-Christmas baseline unlocks three
practical capabilities:

1. **Coherence diagnostics with receipts**  
   - TCS v0.1 + ACS + CHS bands give a single, understandable language
     for AI, robotics, and financial content coherence.
   - Noise Distiller (TCS-ND) and Finance Profile (TCS-Finance) remove AI
     “noise” and quantify Anti-Bubble behaviour.
   - Receipts and anchoring (ts.receipt.v1, QENC ProofCapsule, ledgers)
     make important decisions **provable**.

2. **Robotics safety and hardware law (TS-R)**  
   - TS-R1 and TS-R2 profiles tie metrics to hardware-level rules,
     fallback ladders, Human Mandate roles, and economic impact.
   - CHS Law & Thresholds defines when a robot is allowed to act:
     CHS/L and CHS/M mostly assist-mode, CHS/H normal tasks under
     guardrails, CHS/UH limited high-stakes autonomy.

3. **Productised plans and Devora UX**  
   - Free / Pro / Enterprise / Network tiers define who sees which metrics,
     receipts, and reports.
   - Devora UX Baseline v1.0 gives a consistent, human-readable interface
     for reports, including clear Anti-Bubble explanations and guardrails
     for sensitive domains.

## 3. Execution Map (Next 3–6 Months)

Within the Pre-Christmas baseline, the next execution moves are:

1. **Anchor QENC ProofCapsule and update ledgers**
   - Use QENC Anchoring Playbook v1.0 when OpenTimestamps or equivalent
     services are stably available.
   - Update Integrity Manifest and status docs to ANCHORED state.

2. **First external pilots**
   - Limited Enterprise or Network-tier pilots that:
     - run TCS v0.1 / ACS / CHS,
     - apply TCS-ND and TCS-Finance on real workloads,
     - export receipts using ts.receipt.v1 and TS-R schema.

3. **Feedback into metrics and UX**
   - Measure how well ACS, TCS v0.1, and CHS distributions reflect real
     incidents and risk.
   - Tighten Devora wording and band explanations where users are confused,
     without changing the locked laws or metrics.

## 4. Quick Checklists by Role

**For Commander Nick (Founder)**

- [ ] Confirm that the Pre-Christmas list is fully represented by:
      Status doc, TS-R pack, Devora UX baseline, Finance and Noise profiles,
      Plans and Tiers, QENC playbook, CHS Law & Thresholds.
- [ ] Approve which pilots are allowed to use which tiers and profiles.
- [ ] Decide when to treat this digest as public-facing vs internal.

**For Product / PMs**

- [ ] Every new feature is mapped to a plan (Free / Pro / Enterprise /
      Network).
- [ ] If a feature uses TS-R hardware law, it references the correct TS-R
      docs and CHS bands.
- [ ] Devora UX language is reused from the baseline; no ad-hoc promises.

**For Legal and Risk**

- [ ] Hippocrates and other sensitive profiles are used only under the
      Legal & Safety Baseline, with contracts placing final clinical
      responsibility on clients.
- [ ] Political and election-related use remains out of scope, as defined
      in Plans and Tiers v1.0.
- [ ] Anchoring flows follow the QENC Anchoring Playbook v1.0; any manual
      exceptions are documented and receipted.

This digest should be the **starting page** for anyone trying to understand
what “Pre-Christmas 2025 TruthSeal” actually contains, and where to go next
inside the repo.
