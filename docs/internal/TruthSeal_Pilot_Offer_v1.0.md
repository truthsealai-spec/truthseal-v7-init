# TruthSeal™ — Pilot Offer Baseline v1.0

version: 1.0  
date_utc: 2025-12-02  
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  

scope: |
  Baseline 1–2 page pilot offer for early TruthSeal customers.
  Designed for Enterprise and Network-level partners (regulators, banks,
  cloud / hardware vendors, robotics manufacturers) who want to validate
  TruthSeal in a controlled deployment.

---

## 1. Purpose of the pilot

The TruthSeal pilot is designed to answer one clear question:

> “Can we make our AI systems and robots **provably coherent and governable**, using Traykov’s laws, metrics, and receipts — without breaking our existing workflows?”

By the end of the pilot, the customer should have:

- at least one real system measured with **Traykov Coherence Score v0.1 (TCS v0.1)** and **Aim Coherence Score (ACS)**,  
- clear **Coherence Health Score (CHS)** distributions for selected use-cases,  
- a set of **post-quantum signed, anchored receipts** tied to real events,  
- a short **Executive Coherence Report** that can be shared with internal risk, compliance, and regulators.

---

## 2. Scope options

The pilot can be run in one of three main modes:

### 2.1 Enterprise AI pilot

For banks, insurers, infrastructure operators, or large platforms.

- Target system: one or two high-impact AI workflows (for example: credit-risk models, underwriting tools, incident triage, safety monitoring).  
- Layers in scope:
  - **Laws and metrics**: ULLI, Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence (TQC), Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1), TCS v0.1, ACS, CHS.  
  - **Profiles**: Noise Distiller Profile (TCS-ND v0.2), Finance Profile (TCS-Finance v0.1) where relevant.  
  - **Devora reports**: web console and PDF exports.

### 2.2 Hardware / accelerator pilot (TS-A1)

For chip or cloud providers.

- Target system: one GPU/accelerator line or one managed instance type.  
- Layers in scope:
  - **TS-A1 profile** (accelerator hardware law baseline).  
  - TCS v0.1 / ACS / CHS telemetry hooks.  
  - Receipt generation on configuration changes and model deployments.  
  - Anchoring pipeline with OpenTimestamps or equivalent.

### 2.3 Robotics pilot (TS-R1 / TS-R2)

For robotics manufacturers and integrators.

- Target system: one robot type (TS-R1) or a small fleet (TS-R2).  
- Layers in scope:
  - **TS-R Cherry Checklist v1.0**,  
  - **TS-R Receipt Schema v1.0**,  
  - **TS-R Failure Modes & Fallback Law v1.0**,  
  - **TS-R Human Mandate Layer v1.0**,  
  - **CHS Law & Thresholds v1.0**,  
  - optional **TS-R Swarm Extensions v1.0**.

## 3. Deliverables

Across any of the three modes, the pilot delivers:

1. **Coherence Baseline Report**  
   - TCS v0.1, ACS, and CHS distributions for the selected system.  
   - Key risks identified via Noise Distiller and, if relevant, Finance Profile.  
   - Plain-language narrative for executives and regulators.

2. **Receipt & Anchoring Path**  
   - At least one live **ts.receipt.v1** schema implementation.  
   - Receipts **post-quantum signed** (Dilithium-class) and **anchored** via OpenTimestamps or equivalent.  
   - Example verification walkthrough for risk and audit teams.

3. **Governance Playbook**  
   - Short internal note explaining how ULLI, TQC, LEI = 1, and CHS Law apply to the pilot system.  
   - Recommended changes to internal policies and processes.

4. **Pilot Retrospective Session**  
   - 60–90 minute workshop with product, risk, and legal stakeholders.  
   - Discussion of residual risk, next-step options, and potential Enterprise or Network agreement.

## 4. Timeline (typical)

Total duration: **8–12 weeks**, divided into three phases.

1. **Phase 1 — Setup (2–3 weeks)**  
   - Select pilot system and access model.  
   - Map existing telemetry and logging to TruthSeal metrics.  
   - Configure Devora console and access controls.

2. **Phase 2 — Measurement & Receipts (4–6 weeks)**  
   - Run the system under normal load while collecting metrics and events.  
   - Calibrate thresholds for TCS v0.1, ACS, and CHS.  
   - Implement and test receipt generation and anchoring.

3. **Phase 3 — Reporting & Decision (2–3 weeks)**  
   - Finalize reports and internal playbook.  
   - Deliver executive briefing and technical deep-dive.  
   - Decide on Enterprise or Network tier adoption and, where relevant, TS-A1 or TS-R integration roadmap.

## 5. Plans and pricing alignment

The pilot naturally leads into TruthSeal product tiers:

- **From Free → Pro**  
  Early teams can experiment with coherence reports using the Free plan, then move to Pro to unlock richer metrics and PDF exports during the pilot.

- **Enterprise**  
  The pilot’s receipts, anchoring pipeline, and governance playbook become the foundation of an Enterprise agreement. The same laws, metrics, and dashboards are simply extended to more systems.

- **Network / Platform**  
  Hardware and cloud providers that successfully complete a TS-A1 or TS-R pilot can move into a Network / Platform agreement, embedding TruthSeal for their customers.

Exact commercial terms (fees, discounts, and exclusivity) are handled **case-by-case** and documented in a separate commercial schedule.

## 6. Safety and legal notes

- TruthSeal’s reports are designed to support **risk understanding and governance**, not to replace clinical judgement or financial regulation.  
- The **Hippocrates Profile** (medical context) is available only under explicit Enterprise contracts and is never marketed as diagnosis or treatment.  
- TruthSeal does not provide political campaigning tools, election outcome optimisation, or candidate ranking. The platform is focused on **coherence, safety, and accountability.**
