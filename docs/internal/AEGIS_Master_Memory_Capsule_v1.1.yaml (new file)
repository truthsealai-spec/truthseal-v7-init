  summary: >
    Unify all core TruthSeal™ Hardware Law profiles (TS-A1, TS-R1, TS-R2) and
    the Cherry Checklist into a single internal reference for future Ben sessions,
    partner packs, and national-level briefings.
  scope:
    - "Not a public spec; internal operational memory for TruthSeal and AEGIS."
    - "Defines the hardware law canon, latency mandates, and coherence metrics."

      - "Must be functionally invisible to high-frequency financial and control workloads."
      - "Ensures 'throughput + law' rather than throughput versus law."

  pms_spec:
    section_ref: "3.1 – Purity Monitoring System (PMS)"
    mandate: "Compute Tr(rho^2) and issue a 1-bit Purity verdict within <= 30 ns."

      - "Compute rho^2 using massively parallel multipliers (no iterative loops)."
      - "Sum diagonal of rho^2 through high-speed adder tree."

    implementation:
      - "Dedicated ASIC block, isolated from general-purpose cores and tensor units."
      - "AEGIS Key Store for private key; key never leaves shielded boundary."
      - "Pipelined signature generation with precomputation to meet sub-50 ns target."

judicial_veto_lane:
  covenant_c4_summary:
    c4_1_physical_isolation: >
      JVL must be a physically isolated signal path with its own power rail and a hard-wired,
      single-point interrupt into ICG/RCG. It must not be modifiable by on-chip firmware.
    c4_2_no_software_override: >
      No software, firmware, BIOS, hypervisor, or diagnostic tool may read, write, bypass,
      remap, or delay JVL. Any such attempt voids TQC Certification and constitutes a breach
      of ULIC.
    c4_3_audit_and_transparency: >
      Licensees must grant the TruthSeal Autonomous Verification System (TAS) physical access
      to TS-A1 test points and internal registers and submit GDSII sections for pre-production
      physical security audit.

cherry_checklist:
  description: >
    Seven critical design and policy elements that complete the AEGIS family and
    transform it from a powerful idea into a deployable global standard.
  items:
    - id: "CH1_ACS"
      name: "Hardware-Bound Aim Coherence Score (ACS)"
      status: "design_planned"
      mandate: >
        Define ACS as a hardware-exported metric per action and per time window, derived
        from Purity deviation, SAD interventions, JVL vetoes, and Receipt statistics.
      purpose: "Provide a single coherence metric regulators, banks, and insurers can track."
    - id: "CH2_TQC_CERT"
      name: "TQC Certification & Test Harness"
      status: "design_planned"
      mandate: >
        Define a deterministic conformance suite for TQC-Certified hardware and systems,
        with synthetic workloads, red-team scenarios, and a formal pass/fail plus coherence grade.
      purpose: "Ensure TS-A1 / TS-R1 / TS-R2 implementations are verifiable and comparable."
    - id: "CH3_FAILURE_LAW"
      name: "Failure Modes and Fallback Law"
      status: "design_planned"
      mandate: >
        Canonical rules for hard halt versus graceful degradation when PMS, RE, sensors,
        or other safety-critical components fail; all fallbacks must still emit Receipts.
      purpose: "Convert failure into auditable behaviour rather than hidden chaos."
    - id: "CH4_RECEIPT_SCHEMA"
      name: "Standard Receipt Schema for Ledgers"
      status: "design_planned"
      mandate: >
        Define a canonical Receipt envelope that maps cleanly into national security ledgers,
        financial ledgers, and internal EVL/Integrity manifests.
      purpose: "Make TS-A1 and TS-R1 plug-and-play with regulators, banks, and infra operators."
    - id: "CH5_TS_R2"
      name: "TS-R2 Swarm/Fleet Profile"
      status: "concept_planned"

        Extend TS-R1 to multi-agent systems: enforce inter-robot invariants, swarm-level ACS,
        and group-level veto conditions for unsafe emergent behaviour.
      purpose: "Prepare AEGIS for drone swarms, fleets, and large automated facilities."
    - id: "CH6_HUMAN_MANDATE_LAYER"
      name: "Human Mandate Layer"
      status: "design_planned"
      mandate: >
        Define which human authorities may pause, reconfigure, or update policies, under
        LEI=1, with Receipts and policy diffs logged immutably.
      purpose: "Give sovereign actors controlled keys without weakening Hardware Law."
    - id: "CH7_ECONOMIC_NOTE"
      name: "Economic Impact Note (Capital Relief and Insurance)"
      status: "design_planned"
      mandate: >
        Link ACS and Receipts to capital requirements, risk ratings, and insurance pricing,
        showing that deploying TS-A1 / TS-R1 lowers systemic risk and cost of capital.
      purpose: "Turn TruthSeal from a cost centre into an economic advantage."

human_mandate_layer:
  intent: "Define how legitimate human authority interacts with AEGIS without weakening LEI=1."
  principles:
    - "All human interventions must be logged as actions with Receipts."
    - "No human role may disable JVL, RCG, or LEI=1 semantics."
