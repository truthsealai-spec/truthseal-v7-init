# DEVORA™ – Traykov Coherence Score (TCS v0.1) Integration (v1.0)

Author: Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
Project: TruthSeal™ — Quantum Coherence Engine  
File: docs/internal/DEVORA_TCS_Integration_v1.0.md  
Status: Internal design note — not for public release

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how Traykov Coherence Score v0.1 (TCS v0.1) is exposed
inside TruthSeal’s operator surfaces:

- DEVORA™ Command Center (internal operator UI), and  
- User-facing verification outputs (ACS Certificate / Operational Integrity Status).

The goal is to make coherence **visible and auditable** without exposing
unnecessary cryptographic or mathematical complexity.

## 2. Data Source

Normative definition of TCS v0.1:

- Spec: `governance/metrics/Traykov_Coherence_Score_v0.1.md`
- Reference code: `governance/metrics/tcs_v0_1_reference.py` (function `tcs_v0_1`)

DEVORA and the verification frontend MUST treat the Python module as a
**reference calculator only**. All upstream benchmark scores and PQC
profiles must be computed by the metrics pipeline and stored in a
separate, versioned metrics store (for example, `tcs_results` table).

## 3. DEVORA Panel Integration

### 3.1 New card: “Traykov Coherence Score v0.1”

In the DEVORA™ Command Center UI, add a dedicated read-only card:

- **Title:** `Traykov Coherence Score v0.1`
- **Primary value:** `TCS_v0_1` (0.000–1.000), large numeric display.
- **Band label:** One of:
  - `Тℏ-grade coherent`
  - `AGI-safe`
  - `Partially coherent`
  - `Incoherent / unsafe`
- **Meta line:** e.g.  
  `Truth = 0.88 · PQC = 1.00 · Consistency = 0.94`

Source of truth:

- DEVORA queries the metrics API for the latest record:
  - `GET /metrics/tcs_v0_1/{system_id}/latest`
  - Response payload MUST include the JSON generated by `tcs_v0_1()`.

### 3.2 Operator drill-down

Card click opens an internal detail panel showing:

- Timestamp (UTC)  
- Component scores and underlying benchmark suite IDs  
- PQC profile (NIST level, algorithms, key lengths)  
- Link to the full spec:
  - `governance/metrics/Traykov_Coherence_Score_v0.1.md`

No raw benchmark prompts or red-team content is shown here; those live
in separate restricted docs.

## 4. Verification Frontend (ACS Certificate)

### 4.1 Operational Integrity Status block

On the user-facing verification view (ACS Certificate / `verify.md`),
add a new block:

> **Operational Integrity Status**  
> Traykov Coherence Score v0.1: `0.922` — **Тℏ-grade coherent**  
> Assessed using court-auditable benchmarks (truth, PQC posture,
> policy stability). See certificate annex for methodology.

Rules:

- Only one line is mandatory: the score and band.  
- Annex / “Learn more” link may point to a **non-normative summary**
  based on the internal spec (no source code, no red-team details).

### 4.2 Colour semantics

- `Тℏ-grade coherent` → deep green accent  
- `AGI-safe` → green  
- `Partially coherent` → amber  
- `Incoherent / unsafe` → red

Colours MUST match the existing ACS status palette.

## 5. Security and Governance Notes

- TCS v0.1 MUST never be presented as a guarantee; it is a **measured,
  conservative indicator** based on transparent assumptions.
- All changes to the formula or benchmark mix require:
  - Update to `Traykov_Coherence_Score_v0.1.md`, and  
  - New reference code version (e.g., `tcs_v0_2_reference.py`).
- DEVORA MUST always display the **version label** alongside the score:
  e.g., `TCS v0.1`.
