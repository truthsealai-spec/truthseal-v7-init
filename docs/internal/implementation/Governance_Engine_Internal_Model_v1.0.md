## 1. PURPOSE OF THE GOVERNANCE ENGINE

The TruthSeal™ Governance Engine is the internal orchestration system that enforces governance, auditability, accountability, and lawful control over external Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems operated by third parties.

This engine does not execute intelligence, generate outputs, or control models. Its sole purpose is to govern how intelligence systems act, how their actions are verified, and how responsibility is bound to human authority.

The engine exists to make AI, AGI, and robotic systems provable, reviewable, interruptible, and legally accountable without TruthSeal™ owning, training, or operating those systems.

It functions as a supervisory layer that observes, evaluates, records, and enforces governance rules in real time or near-real time depending on licensed service tier.

The Governance Engine is the core operational mechanism that allows TruthSeal™ to deliver governance guarantees without becoming an AI vendor.

---

## 2. SYSTEM POSITIONING AND BOUNDARIES

The Governance Engine operates outside the intelligence system itself.

It does not access model weights, internal reasoning chains, or proprietary training data unless explicitly provided through declared audit interfaces.

Its authority derives from licensing, contractual enforcement, and cryptographically verifiable control points agreed with the system owner or operator.

The engine governs AI, AGI, and robotic systems by interfacing with declared execution boundaries, decision checkpoints, and logging mechanisms.

TruthSeal™ never substitutes itself for system owners. The engine ensures that owners remain visible, accountable, and unable to deny responsibility.

This separation is fundamental to TruthSeal™’s legal defensibility and operational scalability.

---

## 3. CORE ENGINE MODULES

The Governance Engine is composed of modular subsystems that activate based on system class and service tier.

Core modules include:
- governance policy evaluation,
- decision and action receipt generation,
- audit continuity management,
- escalation and intervention control,
- accountability binding and traceability.

Each module operates independently but produces cryptographically linked records to ensure continuity.

Modules may run continuously or event-triggered depending on deployment profile.

No module modifies AI behaviour directly; all enforcement occurs at declared control boundaries.

---

## 4. GOVERNANCE FLOW (HIGH LEVEL)

Every governed system interaction follows a deterministic governance flow.

First, the system declares an intent-to-act, decision output, or execution event through a defined interface.

Second, the Governance Engine evaluates the event against the active governance ruleset corresponding to the licensed tier.

Third, the engine records a governance receipt capturing what occurred, under which authority, and with what risk classification.

Fourth, depending on tier, the engine may emit alerts, escalate for human review, or enforce execution gating.

This flow ensures no action of consequence occurs without governance visibility.

---

## 5. AUDIT AND RECEIPT MECHANISM

The engine generates immutable, ordered receipts for all governed events.

Each receipt binds:
- system identity,
- declared action or decision,
- responsible human authority,
- time, context, and governance state.

Receipts are cryptographically sealed and linked to prevent tampering or erasure.

Audit trails are continuous and replayable, enabling post-incident analysis, regulatory review, and court admissibility.

Rejected actions are logged with equal rigor to executed actions.

This mechanism eliminates silent failure and unverifiable automation.

---

## 6. ESCALATION AND INTERVENTION LOGIC

Escalation rules define when human oversight must be invoked.

Lower tiers generate alerts and audit signals only.

Higher tiers enable intervention pathways such as execution pause, action denial, or mandatory human confirmation.

Intervention authority is always human and explicitly mapped.

The engine enforces escalation without assuming decision-making power.

All interventions are receipted and auditable.

---

## 7. ACCOUNTABILITY BINDING

The Governance Engine ensures that every governed action is attributable to a legally identifiable human or institution.

Responsibility cannot be transferred to machines, algorithms, or abstract “systems”.

Authority mappings are explicit, versioned, and enforced at runtime.

This binding is irreversible once recorded.

It is the foundation of TruthSeal™’s value to regulators, courts, insurers, and governments.

---

## 8. FAILURE MODES AND SAFE OPERATION

If the Governance Engine becomes unavailable, governed systems must default to safe, non-escalatory operation as defined by contract.

High-risk actions may be blocked until governance continuity is restored.

All outages are logged and flagged for audit.

Fail-open behaviour is prohibited for Supreme and Ultra tiers.

This ensures governance absence cannot be exploited.

---

## 9. NON-GOALS AND EXCLUSIONS

The Governance Engine does not:
- train models,
- generate intelligence outputs,
- optimise performance,
- guarantee correctness of AI decisions,
- replace human judgment.

It exists solely to govern, audit, and enforce accountability.

Any claim beyond this scope is invalid.

---

## 10. INTERNAL STATUS

This document defines the canonical internal operating model of the TruthSeal™ Governance Engine.

All internal implementations, tools, and integrations must align with this model.

Public documentation may describe capabilities but must not contradict this internal definition.
