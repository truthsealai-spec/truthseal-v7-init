# TruthSeal™ TQC Editorial Standard v1.0
version: 1.0
date_utc: 2025-12-04
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)
scope: “Compendium” (40 chapters) and related public-safe canon

## Purpose
Guarantee a single, court-ready voice across all chapters: philosophically rigorous, mathematically exact, and institution-ready.

## Audience
Heads of state, regulators, standards bodies, defence & safety councils, scientific committees, sovereign investors, and robotics manufacturers.

## Voice & Dignity Rules
- Impartial, diplomatic, and precise; avoid marketing language and rhetorical flourish.
- No first-person singular. Use institutional phrasing and attribute authorship as “Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.).”
- When doctrine is sensitive, state the public operational rule and mark deeper doctrine as CLASSIFIED.

## Acronym Policy (strict)
- Expand at first use: “Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1)”; then use acronym consistently.
- Keep all acronyms listed in `governance/ledger/glossary/Acronyms_Register_v1.0.yaml`.
- Never introduce unregistered acronyms in sovereign docs.

## Chapter Architecture (dual-lane)
Each chapter must contain:
1) Premise & Scope (2–4 lines).
2) Philosophical Lane — moral intent, governance anchors (e.g., LEI = 1), and concise morphological thinking (dimensions, states, cross-consistency).
3) Mathematical Lane — symbols, assumptions, invariants, core equations, proof/argument sketch (≤10 lines), falsifiers.
4) Protocols — tests, windows, pass/fail thresholds, and receipts/anchoring plan.
5) Risks & Mitigations.
6) Deliverables & Done criteria.
7) Acronyms used (expanded at first use).

## Mathematical Presentation (norms)
- Symbols: ACS ∈ [0,1]; TCS ∈ [0,1] with {Baseline, Silver, Gold, Diamond}; thresholds explicit (e.g., θ_ACS = 0.90).
- Structure: Definitions → Claims → Equations → Proof/argument sketch → Testable consequences.
- Never restate canonical formulas inconsistently; reference Traykov Coherence Score (TCS) v0.1 and Aim Coherence Score (ACS) canon.

## Receipts & Anchoring
- Every significant state transition emits a `ts.receipt.v1` record with: `ots_calendar_id`, `ots_status`, `ots_tx`, `originstamp_id`, `btcstamp_tx`, `anchored_rfc3339`.
- If anchor data is not yet available, set UNKNOWN and update immediately on receipt.
- Integrity Manifest is the single source of truth for anchor status.

## Classified Handling
- ULIC Continuum, PODAPAR, Infinity Formula: DOCTORANTURA-ONLY unless explicitly cleared.
- Redact internal Ω doctrine; publish only the operational TLC threshold rule.

## Political Dignity Safeguards
- Prohibit partisan framing. Reference law, standards, and evidence; avoid speculative or escalatory language.
- When discussing national-security alignment, cite certification criteria and receipts rather than opinion.

## Compliance Gate (checklist per chapter)
- Philosophy gate passed (intent + morphology + governance anchors).
- Math gate passed (symbols + thresholds + equations + falsifiers).
- Evidence gate passed (tests + receipts + anchor plan).
- Acronym gate passed (first-use expansions + register consistency).
