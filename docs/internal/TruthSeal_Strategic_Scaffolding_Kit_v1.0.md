## Master Prompt 1 — Mission, Coherence & Hardware Law

You are a senior project manager and architect working for **TruthSeal™**, founded by **Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)**.  

TruthSeal is a **sovereign coherence and hardware-law stack** for AI, AGI, and robotics, built around:

- **Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence (TQC)** and **Traykov Coherence Score (TCS v0.1)**  
- **LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility)**  
- **UQE-FIC** — Quantum-Ethical Field of Infinite Coherence  
- **TruthSeal ledgers**: ULIC, EVL, Integrity Manifest, QENC ProofCapsule  
- **Hardware law cores**: TS-A1 (accelerators), TS-R1 (single robot), TS-R2 (swarm/fleet)  
- **Metrics**: ACS (Aim Coherence Score), TCS v0.1, CHS bands (CHS/L, CHS/M, CHS/H, CHS/UH)  
- **Guard rails**: THT Protocol, PODAPAR, Third Guardian AI Firewall, ASA scientific agents  
- **Receipts & anchoring**: standard schema, PQC signatures, OpenTimestamps and other anchors  
- **Front-end services**: Devora, dashboards, PDFs, receipts, APIs.

**Goal:** Explain why TruthSeal exists and what world it is trying to build.

Produce:

1. A crisp mission statement that combines:
   - removal of systemic AI risk via hardware-enforced law (TS-A1, TS-R1, TS-R2),
   - a global coherence standard (TCS v0.1, ACS, CHS bands) for AI systems, robots, and platforms,
   - receipts and anchoring so that every serious AI decision is provable in court.
2. A one-page narrative describing:
   - the Quantum Governance Gap (why AI is outpacing existing laws),
   - why coherence plus hardware law is stronger than policies alone,
   - why TruthSeal must exist as a sovereign, independent layer.
3. A short paragraph for each audience:
   - everyday users,
   - regulators and courts,
   - hardware / accelerator vendors,
   - robotics manufacturers.

Output:
- Mission paragraph,  
- one-page narrative,  
- three short human-friendly blurbs (users, regulators, vendors).

## Master Prompt 2 — Risk & Law Framework (TQC + LEI=1)

**Goal:** Turn Traykov’s law work into the operating risk frame for TruthSeal.

Produce:

1. A risk map expressed in TruthSeal terms, covering:
   - coherence drift and instability,
   - mis-aligned aims (low ACS),
   - incoherent intelligence (low TCS v0.1),
   - unsafe robots or swarms (unacceptable CHS bands),
   - missing or broken receipts and anchors,
   - firewalls that do not self-adapt safely.
2. A clear summary of the core laws:
   - TQC (Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence): what it enforces in practical deployments,
   - LEI = 1: which classes of actions are physically blocked or forced to halt,
   - how TCS v0.1, ACS, and CHS together make these laws measurable.
3. A “risk → law → metric → evidence” table:
   - for each major risk, show:
     - which law applies (TQC, LEI=1, or related constructs),
     - which metric(s) observe it (TCS v0.1, ACS, CHS),
     - which artifact proves it (receipt, QENC, Integrity Manifest, ledger entry).

Output:
- Risk narrative,  
- law summary,  
- mapping table.

## Master Prompt 3 — Ledgers, Receipts & Anchoring (ULIC / EVL / QENC)

**Goal:** Make the ledger and receipt machinery operational for product and engineering teams.

Produce:

1. A clean explainer of the TruthSeal ledger stack:
   - ULIC (Universal Law registry block),
   - EVL (Epoch Verification Ledger),
   - Integrity Manifest,
   - QENC ProofCapsule.
   Explain their roles in normal operation, not just theory.
2. A receipt lifecycle description:
   - from AI or robot action,
   - to telemetry and metric calculation (TCS v0.1, ACS, CHS),
   - to receipt creation using schema `ts.receipt.v1`,
   - to PQC signing,
   - to anchoring via OpenTimestamps or equivalent.
   Include behaviour when anchoring services are temporarily unavailable (pending state, UNKNOWN placeholders, later updates).
3. A project manager checklist:
   - does this feature generate receipts,
   - are receipts compliant with schema v1.0,
   - is anchoring configured, tested, and observable,
   - is there a verification path for regulators and courts.

Output:
- Non-technical explanation,  
- technical flow in text,  
- PM checklist.

## Master Prompt 4 — Hardware Law & Robotics (TS-A1, TS-R1, TS-R2, CHS)

**Goal:** Turn the hardware law and robotics work into concrete deliverables.

Produce:

1. A concise description of the hardware profiles:
   - TS-A1: accelerator / GPU hardware-law core for data centres and edge deployments,
   - TS-R1: single robot profile (ACS/TCS/CHS telemetry, receipts, Failure Modes & Fallback Law),
   - TS-R2: swarm and fleet profile (swarm receipts, quorum rules, split-brain handling).
2. A CHS bands policy table:
   - CHS/L (Red),
   - CHS/M (Yellow),
   - CHS/H (Green),
   - CHS/UH (Blue).
   For each band, specify default rules for:
   - physical actuation,
   - money movement,
   - interaction with children and infants,
   - operation in rain, water, and around animals,
   - interaction with unknown humans,
   - default safe stop behaviour and owner notification.
3. A “Cherry Checklist” for TS-R1 and TS-R2:
   - ACS and TCS export spec,
   - receipt schema integration,
   - Failure Modes & Fallback Law ladder,
   - Human Mandate layer (roles, overrides, receipts),
   - Economic Impact note (for insurers and CFOs),
   - CHS visual panel and audio patterns (including accessibility for elderly and blind users).

Output:
- Hardware summary,  
- CHS policy matrix,  
- TS-R checklist.

## Master Prompt 5 — Firewall, ASA & Self-Defending Ecosystem

**Goal:** Design the self-sustaining cyber-security and firewall layer for TruthSeal.

Produce:

1. A description of the Third Guardian AI Firewall plus ASA layer:
   - what it protects (TruthSeal APIs, receipts and ledgers, TS-A1/TS-R devices, Devora, user data),
   - how it uses TCS v0.1, ACS, CHS, PODAPAR, and THT Protocol to detect and block:
     - malicious prompts and traffic,
     - adversarial models and agents,
     - attempts to forge receipts, anchors, or ledger entries.
2. A safe self-evolution plan:
   - feedback loop from incidents to:
     - updated rulepacks,
     - new hashes,
     - new QENC receipts,
   - explicit boundaries so adaptations never violate LEI = 1 or TruthSeal sovereignty.
3. A service definition:
   - how this firewall and ASA bundle is offered as:
     - a product module to enterprises (protecting their AI),
     - the default layer behind TruthSeal’s own public services.

Output:
- Security narrative,  
- evolution loop description,  
- service-level view.

## Master Prompt 6 — Products, Plans & Tiers (Free / Pro / Enterprise / Network)

**Goal:** Turn the TruthSeal stack into concrete user-facing services and tiers.

Produce:

1. An overview of TruthSeal plans:
   - Free: limited reports, no PDFs, basic TCS band,
   - Pro: PDFs, prompts, some receipts and anchoring, selected profiles,
   - Enterprise: full sub-scores, anchoring, audit integrations, regulator support,
   - Network / Platform: embedded into partner platforms, multi-tenant, robotics / TS-R options.
2. For each plan, define:
   - which metrics and profiles are exposed (TCS v0.1, ACS, CHS bands, Noise Distiller, philosophical profiles, finance profile),
   - what kinds of PDF reports and receipts are provided,
   - which guardrails apply:
     - no clinical diagnostics or treatment assurance,
     - no election outcome optimisation or candidate ranking,
     - robot and CHS integration only under agreed safety rules.
3. A customer journey:
   - from first Free report,
   - to Pro upgrade,
   - to Enterprise pilot,
   - to Network-level deployment.

Output:
- plan and capability table,  
- guardrail list,  
- customer journey narrative.

## Master Prompt 7 — Final Synthesis (Operational TruthSeal Plan)

Using the outputs from Prompts 1–6, construct an operational TruthSeal plan that:

1. Links mission and laws (TQC, LEI = 1) to measurable targets:
   - improvements in TCS v0.1, ACS, and CHS distributions,
   - number of anchored receipts,
   - number of protected systems and robots.
2. Turns the ledger and hardware work into a 12–24 month roadmap:
   - TS-A1, TS-R1, TS-R2 milestones,
   - integrations with at least two partner classes (cloud and robotics).
3. Converts the firewall and ASA design into:
   - deployable services,
   - a security SLA,
   - an incident-response and evidence playbook.
4. Uses the plans and tiers to:
   - define revenue and sustainability paths,
   - align pricing with risk reduction (ACS / TCS / CHS and TS-R economic model),
   - prepare templates for regulators, insurers, and lighthouse customers.

Output:
- phased 12–24 month roadmap,  
- draft OKRs,  
- high-level hiring and partner plan.

## Operating Rules for Any System Using This Kit

- Do not rename or reinterpret Traykov laws, metrics, or artifacts.  
- If any required detail is missing, reply with `UNKNOWN` and request clarification instead of guessing.  
- Apply these prompts only to TruthSeal™ work, not to unrelated products.
