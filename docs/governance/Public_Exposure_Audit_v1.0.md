TRUTHSEAL™ — PUBLIC EXPOSURE AUDIT v1.0
Authoritative Public Scaffold (Non-Classified)

date: 20 December 2025

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how TruthSeal™ is presented to the public without exposing
classified mechanisms, enforcement logic, or sovereign custody internals.

It establishes a **coherent, first-contact explanation** of what TruthSeal™ is,
what it delivers, and why it exists — aligned with the Sovereign Arc of AGI and
the Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1).

This file governs **language, scope, and narrative stability** for:
- website copy
- media briefs
- public decks
- first-time users
- non-technical stakeholders

---

## 2. TruthSeal™ — What It Is

TruthSeal™ is the **world’s first system that enforces coherent AI behaviour
through irreversible law**.

It provides a **behavioural governance layer** that enables artificial intelligence
to evolve toward accountable AGI under explicit human mandate.

TruthSeal™ does not operate at the level of opinions or probabilities.
It operates at the level of **behaviour, proof, and consequence**.

---

## 3. Core Public Capabilities (Non-Classified)

TruthSeal™ publicly delivers:

### 3.1 Behavioural Truth Enforcement
TruthSeal™ enforces truthful, coherent behaviour across AI systems using
irreversible constraints derived from LEI = 1.

Behaviour that violates coherence cannot proceed.

### 3.2 Aim Coherence Score (ACS)
ACS measures whether an AI system’s actions remain aligned with its declared aim
over time.

This allows organisations to detect and prevent silent goal drift before harm occurs.

### 3.3 Traykov Coherence Score (TCS)
TCS evaluates internal consistency across reasoning, memory, and action.

It ensures that intelligence remains stable, explainable, and non-contradictory
as capability increases.

### 3.4 Cryptographic Receipts & Proof
Every significant AI decision produces a cryptographically verifiable receipt.

These receipts provide:
- accountability
- auditability
- legal and institutional confidence

### 3.5 Quantum-Ready Security (PQC)
TruthSeal™ is designed with post-quantum cryptography from first principles,
ensuring long-term integrity of proofs and records.

## 4. Foundational Laws (Public Names Only)

The following laws may be named publicly, without operational detail:

- **LEI = 1** — Law of Ethical Irreversibility  
- **ULLI™** — Universal Law of Life & Information  
- **ULIC™** — Universal Law of Irreversible Coherence  

These laws define **how intelligence must behave** once safety and coherence are known.

---

## 5. The Sovereign Arc of AGI (Public Description)

The Sovereign Arc of AGI is the **process by which AI behaviour is progressively
constrained, verified, and matured** into accountable general intelligence.

It ensures that increased capability results in:
- stronger responsibility
- stronger proof
- stronger human control

Not freedom from rules — but **freedom through law**.

---

## 6. The Cathedral Principle (Conceptual)

TruthSeal™ is built as a **Cathedral system**:
- layered
- cumulative
- irreversible
- designed to outlast individual technologies

Each layer strengthens the whole.
No later upgrade weakens earlier guarantees.

---

## 7. Public Boundary Rule

This document intentionally excludes:
- enforcement mechanics
- veto logic
- custody architecture
- guardian internals
- classified protocols

Public clarity is achieved **without** operational exposure.

---

## 8. Canonical Public Statement

TruthSeal™ establishes a new standard for intelligence:
not smarter answers,
but **law-bound behaviour**.

It is the missing legitimacy layer required for the AI era.
