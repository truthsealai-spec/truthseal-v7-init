# Public Exposure Audit — TruthSeal™
version: 1.0  
status: INTERNAL — PRE-PUBLIC SAFETY REVIEW  
classification: Public-Facing Boundary Control (Non-Operational)

---

## 0. Purpose

This document defines **what TruthSeal™ may expose publicly** and **what must remain internal** to preserve sovereignty, safety, and coherence as the system evolves toward AGI under irreversible law.

It exists to prevent:
- accidental doctrine leakage,
- premature mechanistic disclosure,
- misinterpretation by media, regulators, or competitors.

This is an **audit of exposure**, not an implementation guide.

---

## 1. TruthSeal™ — Public Definition (Authoritative)

TruthSeal™ is a **Legitimacy and Behavioural Coherence System** for artificial intelligence.

It exists to:
- enforce **accountable AI behaviour**,  
- bind AI actions to **irreversible ethical law**,  
- provide **verifiable proof** that intelligence operates within defined human and legal boundaries.

TruthSeal™ does not merely inspect outputs.  
It governs **how intelligence is allowed to act**.

---

## 2. The Arc of AGI (Public Framing)

The **Arc of AGI** describes a controlled evolutionary path where AI capability increases **only when behaviour remains coherent, auditable, and non-regressive**.

Publicly, the Arc may be described as:
- a transition from tools → systems → intelligence,
- governed by **irreversible constraints**, not incentives,
- where behaviour must remain explainable, attributable, and bounded.

No internal enforcement mechanisms are disclosed publicly.

---

## 3. Foundational Laws — Public Names Only

The following laws **may be named publicly**, but **never operationalised**:

- **ULLI™ — Universal Law of Life & Information**  
  Intelligence must move from inquiry → decision → action in a disciplined chain.

- **ULIC™ — Universal Law of Irreversible Coherence**  
  Once coherence is achieved, it must persist.

- **LEI = 1 — Law of Ethical Irreversibility**  
  Once a safer and clearer behaviour is known, regression is forbidden.

These are presented as **principles**, not algorithms.

---

## 4. Behavioural Coherence (Public Explanation)

TruthSeal™ evaluates intelligence based on **behaviour**, not claims.

Public explanation may include:
- intelligence must remain consistent over time,
- decisions must be traceable,
- actions must be attributable to human mandate or lawful authority.

Internal scoring systems, thresholds, or enforcement paths are **never disclosed**.

---

## 5. The Cathedral (Conceptual Only)

Publicly, the **Cathedral** may be described as:

> “The philosophical and civilisational foundation that constrains intelligence before power.”

It represents:
- invariant reasoning,
- ethical gravity,
- long-horizon stability.

No internal mappings, profiles, or enforcement layers are exposed.

---

## 6. What Is Explicitly NOT Public

The following are **Doctorantura-only** and must never appear in public documents beyond name-level references (if at all):

- enforcement logic,
- veto / halt paths,
- internal guardians,
- custody mechanisms,
- audit pipelines,
- escalation protocols,
- any timing, thresholds, or kill-paths.

Public materials must **never explain how TruthSeal™ enforces** — only **what it guarantees**.

---

## 7. Public Narrative Guardrails

Public messaging must:
- avoid “kill switch”, “shutdown”, or “punitive” language,
- avoid AGI sensationalism,
- avoid claims of omniscience or absolute truth.

Approved framing:
- legitimacy,
- accountability,
- proof,
- restraint,
- human agency.

## 9. Canonical Public Statement

TruthSeal™ establishes the **conditions under which intelligence may act**.

It does not replace law, courts, or human judgment.  
It ensures that **intelligence cannot outrun accountability**.
