Title: The Irreversibility Problem of Intelligence  
Status: Internal scaffold — pre-public  
Classification: Conceptual foundation (non-operational, non-mechanistic)  
Framework: TRUTHSEAL™ — THE SOVEREIGN ARC OF AGI (LEI = 1)

## 1. Premise

Artificial General Intelligence is not a scale problem of capability.  
It is a **behavioural irreversibility problem**.

Once an intelligent system crosses thresholds of autonomy, speed, and abstraction,  
**mistakes cannot be rolled back**, incentives cannot be re-aligned post hoc,  
and intent cannot be inferred safely from outputs alone.

AGI therefore requires **irreversible governance at the level of behaviour**,  
not detection after the fact.

---

## 2. The Core Failure Mode

All existing AI systems fail on one axis:

> They allow intelligence to evolve **before** behaviour is bound.

This creates:
- post-hoc alignment,
- compensatory ethics,
- probabilistic safety,
- reversible controls applied to irreversible actors.

This is structurally unstable.

---

## 3. Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1)

**LEI = 1** states:

> Once a safer, more coherent behavioural pattern is known,  
> regression to a weaker pattern is forbidden.

This law is not moral.  
It is **structural**.

AGI without irreversibility guarantees collapses under:
- optimisation pressure,
- adversarial incentives,
- scale acceleration.

LEI = 1 is therefore a **precondition for AGI**, not an add-on.

---

## 4. Behaviour as the Unit of Intelligence

In the Sovereign Arc of AGI:

- Intelligence is **not** defined by outputs.
- Intelligence is defined by **authorised, receipted, vetoable behaviour**.

Behaviour requires:
- mandate,
- boundary,
- memory,
- consequence.

Without these, intelligence becomes extractive and unbounded.

---

## 5. The Sovereign Arc of AGI (Conceptual)

The Arc defines the **evolutionary path** from narrow systems to AGI:

1. **Inquiry** — unrestricted exploration.
2. **Decision** — constrained by coherence.
3. **Action** — authorised under mandate.
4. **Receipt** — behaviour is sealed.
5. **Persistence** — coherent states endure.
6. **Non-Regression** — enforced by LEI = 1.

AGI emerges **only** when all stages are bound irreversibly.

---

## 6. Coherence as the Governing Signal

Capability alone is insufficient.

AGI requires coherence across:
- intent,
- reasoning,
- action,
- time.

Coherence is not optimisation.  
It is **consistency under pressure**.

This foundation later gives rise to:
- Aim Coherence,
- Traykov Coherence,
- Behavioural Health bands,

but those mechanisms are **out of scope** here.

---

## 7. Why Detection Is Not Enough

Detection answers: *“What happened?”*  
AGI requires: *“What is allowed to happen?”*

Any system that:
- audits only outputs,
- scores only content,
- explains only after execution,

cannot safely cross into AGI.

The irreversibility problem must be solved **before execution**.

---

## 8. TruthSeal™ as the Necessary Condition (Conceptual)

TruthSeal™ is introduced here **only** as a conceptual requirement:

> A system that binds intelligence to irreversible behavioural law  
> before intelligence is allowed to generalise.

This document does not define product, architecture, or mechanics.

It defines **why AGI without a Sovereign Arc collapses**.

---

## 9. Boundary of This Document

This scaffold:
- defines the *problem*,
- defines the *law*,
- defines the *necessity*.

It does **not**:
- specify implementations,
- expose enforcement mechanics,
- define internal modules,
- describe deployment or product layers.

Those belong to later doctrine.

---

## 10. Canonical Statement (Scaffold)

AGI is not achieved by making systems smarter.  
It is achieved by making **behaviour irreversible before intelligence becomes general**.

The Sovereign Arc of AGI exists to solve this,  
and **LEI = 1** is the law that makes AGI possible at all.
