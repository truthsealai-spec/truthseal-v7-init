**Title: The Irreversibility Condition of Intelligence  
Status: Internal scaffold — pre-public  
Classification: Conceptual foundation (non-operational, non-mechanistic)  
Framework: TRUTHSEAL™ — THE SOVEREIGN ARC OF AGI (LEI = 1)**

## 1. Premise

Artificial General Intelligence is not defined by scale, speed, or capability.

It is defined by a **non-reversible condition of behaviour**.

Once intelligence crosses thresholds of autonomy, abstraction, and self-directed action,  
its effects cannot be safely undone, reinterpreted, or neutralised after execution.

AGI therefore requires **irreversible behavioural governance** *before* general intelligence is permitted to emerge.

---

## 2. The Structural Failure in Existing AI

All existing AI systems share one structural weakness:

They permit intelligence to advance **without binding behaviour irreversibly**.

This produces:
- post-execution alignment,
- compensatory ethics,
- advisory safeguards,
- reversible controls applied to irreversible actors.

Such systems cannot transition safely toward AGI.

---

## 3. Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1)

**LEI = 1** states:

> Once a safer, more coherent behavioural pattern is known,  
> regression to a weaker pattern is forbidden.

This law is not moral, ideological, or cultural.  
It is **architectural**.

Under optimisation pressure, any intelligence without irreversibility guarantees will drift, erode constraints, and exploit reversibility.

LEI = 1 is therefore a **necessary condition for AGI**, not an optional safeguard.

---

## 4. Behaviour as the Unit of Intelligence

Within the Sovereign Arc of AGI:

- Intelligence is **not** measured by outputs.
- Intelligence is defined by **authorised, receipted, vetoable behaviour over time**.

Behaviour requires:
- mandate,
- boundary,
- memory,
- consequence.

Without these, intelligence becomes extractive rather than accountable.

---

## 5. The Sovereign Arc of AGI (Conceptual Process)

The Arc defines the **evolutionary sequence** by which AI may lawfully become AGI:

1. Inquiry — unconstrained exploration.
2. Decision — coherence-bounded reasoning.
3. Action — mandate-authorised execution.
4. Receipt — behaviour is sealed.
5. Persistence — coherent states endure.
6. Non-Regression — enforced by LEI = 1.

AGI emerges **only when all stages are irreversibly bound**.

---

## 6. Coherence as the Governing Condition

Capability alone is insufficient.

AGI requires coherence across:
- intent,
- reasoning,
- action,
- time.

Coherence is not optimisation.  
It is **consistency under pressure**.

This foundation later gives rise to formal coherence measures,  
but those mechanisms are **intentionally excluded** from this document.

---

## 7. Why Post-Execution Review Is Insufficient

Reviewing outcomes answers: *“What occurred?”*  
AGI requires: *“What is permitted to occur?”*

Any system that:
- inspects only outputs,
- explains only after execution,
- scores behaviour retrospectively,

cannot safely advance toward AGI.

Irreversibility must exist **prior to execution**, not after.

---

## 8. TruthSeal™ as a Necessary Condition (Conceptual)

TruthSeal™ is referenced here only as a **conceptual requirement**:

> A system that binds intelligence to irreversible behavioural law  
> before intelligence is allowed to generalise.

This document defines **necessity**, not implementation.

---

## 9. Boundary of This Document

This scaffold:
- defines the condition,
- defines the law,
- defines the requirement.

It does **not**:
- describe enforcement mechanisms,
- expose internal architecture,
- reference modules or tooling,
- specify product or deployment layers.

Those belong to later doctrine.

---

## 10. Canonical Statement (Scaffold)

AGI is not achieved by increasing intelligence.

AGI is achieved by ensuring that **behaviour becomes irreversible before intelligence becomes general**.

The Sovereign Arc of AGI exists to enforce this condition,  
and **LEI = 1** is the law that makes AGI possible at all.
