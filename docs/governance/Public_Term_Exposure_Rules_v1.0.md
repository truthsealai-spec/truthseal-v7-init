Purpose:
Define which TruthSeal™ terms may appear in PUBLIC documents
(Compendium, Blueprint, Product pages) and under what limits.

RULE:

it MUST NOT appear in public documents.

## Allowed in Public (Name Only — No Mechanics)
- LEI = 1
- EVL™ (label only)

## Doctorantura-Only (STRICTLY INTERNAL)

- - Noise Distiller™ (signal suppression, coherence purification, or semantic filtering logic)

## Enforcement
All public-facing documents MUST be checked against this file
before release. Violations constitute a classification breach.
