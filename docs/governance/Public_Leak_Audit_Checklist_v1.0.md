# TruthSeal™ — Public Leak Audit Checklist v1.0

Purpose:
Identify and flag Doctorantura-only terms that MUST NOT appear in any public-facing material
(Compendium, Blueprint, Website, Product pages, Marketing).

Rule:
If a term enforces, vetoes, gates, halts, audits, purifies, suppresses, or touches custody,
it is STRICTLY Doctorantura-only.
