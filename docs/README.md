## 1. Purpose of This Index

This file defines the **authoritative documentation boundaries** for the TruthSeal™ repository.

It establishes:
- what is **public-facing**,
- what is **restricted**,
- what is **sovereign / internal-only**, and
- how reviewers, partners, and regulators must navigate the documentation set.

No document may override this hierarchy.

---

## 2. Public Documentation (ONLY)

The **only public-facing materials** in this repository are located in:
docs/public/
These documents are:
- conceptual only,
- non-operational,
- non-authoritative,
- non-enforcing.

They exist solely to explain intent, philosophy, and high-level structure.

### Public Entry Points
- `docs/public/README_PUBLIC_SCOPE.md`
- `docs/public/Hardware_Governance_Interface_Public_Concept_v1.0.md`

No other folder, file, or path is public by default.

---

## 3. Restricted / Partner Documentation

All materials intended for:
- partners,
- vendors,
- regulators under NDA,
- pilots or evaluations

are located under:
governance/partners/
These materials are **derivative**, **non-authoritative**, and operate strictly under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

They do not create law, mandate adoption, or establish regulatory authority.

---

## 4. Sovereign / Internal Documentation

All documents governing:
- authority,
- law,
- enforcement,
- custody,
- ledgers,
- certification,
- internal governance

## 5. Navigation Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Partners must be explicitly directed into `governance/partners/`
- No public link may deep-link into sovereign folders
- No derivative document may redefine authority or law

Violations are treated as scope breaches under LEI = 1.
