# TRUTHSEAL™ — DOCUMENTATION INDEX (v1.1)

Authority: TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc — Authority Index (v1.0)  
Governance Invariant: LEI = 1  
Owner & Architect: Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)

## 1. Purpose of This Index

This file defines the **authoritative navigation and boundary rules** for all documentation contained within the TruthSeal™ repository.

It establishes:
- the **single public entry path**,
- the separation between **public**, **restricted**, and **sovereign/internal** materials,
- and the correct navigation order for reviewers, partners, and regulators.

No document may override this hierarchy.

---

## 2. Public Documentation (ONLY)

All **public-facing, non-operational, non-enforcement** materials are located **exclusively** in:

➡️ **`docs/public/`**

### Canonical public entry:
- **Public Scope Definition (MANDATORY FIRST READ)**  
  → `docs/public/README_PUBLIC_SCOPE.md`

### Public conceptual materials include:
- Hardware governance concepts
- Cathedral & sovereign arc overviews
- Public FAQs and glossaries
- Conceptual roadmaps
- Exposure and disclosure audits

These documents:
- do **not** expose enforcement logic,
- do **not** describe custody systems,
- do **not** create mandate, authority, or exclusivity.

---

## 3. Restricted / Partner / Review Materials

Restricted materials (partner packs, technical handoffs, financial or validation documents) are **not public-facing** and must be accessed only through their **explicit indices**.

Examples:
- `governance/partners/`
- `governance/guards/`
- `docs/internal/`

Access is contextual, invitation-based, and scope-bound.

---

## 4. Sovereign / Internal Documentation

Sovereign and internal materials include:
- enforcement logic,
- custody mechanisms,
- governance execution systems,
- ledger internals,
- hardware-law specifications.

These materials are **not public**, **not promotional**, and **not reviewable without authority**.

They are governed exclusively by the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

---

## 5. Navigation Rules (MANDATORY)

- External readers **must start** at:  
  → `docs/public/README_PUBLIC_SCOPE.md`
- This file (**docs/README.md**) is an **index**, not a content document.
- Public documents may not link into internal or sovereign paths.
- Internal documents may reference public documents, never the reverse.

---

## 6. Enforcement Note

Any document found outside its permitted scope is:
- non-canonical,
- non-authoritative,
- and subject to removal or quarantine.

---

End of file.
