## 2. One-paragraph elevator pitch

TruthSeal™ is a **sovereign coherence and hardware-law stack** for AI systems, accelerators, and robots. It combines Traykov’s laws — including **Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence (TQC)** and **Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1)** — with measurable metrics such as **Traykov Coherence Score v0.1 (TCS v0.1)**, **Aim Coherence Score (ACS)**, and **Coherence Health Score (CHS)**. Every serious AI decision can be captured as a **cryptographically signed receipt**, anchored via **OpenTimestamps** or equivalent, so regulators, insurers, and courts can verify what happened, when, and under which constraints.

## 3. Why TruthSeal exists (Quantum Governance Gap)

Modern AI systems move faster than law. Models deploy daily, GPUs are sold by the million, and robots are leaving the lab — yet:

- there is no common **coherence standard** for AI behaviour,  
- hardware and software can silently **drift** away from safe configurations,  
- when something goes wrong, **evidence is missing** or scattered across logs.

This is the **Quantum Governance Gap**: our legal frameworks expect proof, but our AI stacks deliver only screenshots and claims.

TruthSeal closes this gap by:

- defining clear **laws** for coherence and ethical irreversibility,  
- attaching **metrics** that make those laws measurable,  
- producing **receipts** that can stand up in court,  
- anchoring those receipts to **public time** using Bitcoin-backed timestamping.

## 4. What TruthSeal does (three pillars)

### 4.1 Laws and metrics

TruthSeal defines a compact law and metric set:

- **ULLI — TruthSeal governing proof mandate**  
  Academic Authority Proof, Technical Immutability Proof, Live Measurability Proof.

- **Traykov Law of Quantum Coherence (TQC)**  
  Hardware-anchored law that demands non-degrading coherent behaviour over time.

- **Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1)**  
  Once a safer, more coherent configuration is found, the system must not revert to a worse one.

- **Traykov Coherence Score v0.1 (TCS v0.1)**  
  0–1 metric for overall intelligence coherence (truthfulness, post-quantum security, long-horizon self-consistency).

- **Aim Coherence Score (ACS)**  
  0–1 metric for how well actions follow a declared aim and safety constraints over time.

- **Coherence Health Score (CHS)**  
  Four-band status indicator:
  - CHS/L — Low (Red),  
  - CHS/M — Medium (Yellow),  
  - CHS/H — High (Green),  
  - CHS/UH — Ultra High (Blue).

Profiles such as the **Noise Distiller Profile (TCS-ND)** and **Finance Profile (TCS-Finance)** build on these metrics to filter hype and risk-blind narratives.

### 4.2 Hardware law and robotics

TruthSeal provides hardware-level profiles:

- **TS-A1 — Accelerator / GPU Profile**  
  For data-centre and edge chips. Exposes TCS v0.1, ACS, and CHS telemetry. Enforces LEI = 1 on configuration changes. Hooks into the receipt system.

- **TS-R1 — Robotics Profile (single robot)**  
  Applies CHS Law to a single robot: which actions are allowed at CHS/L, CHS/M, CHS/H, CHS/UH; how fallback works; how human overrides are recorded.

- **TS-R2 — Robotics Profile (swarm / fleet)**  
  Extends TS-R1 to fleets and swarms, including swarm-level receipts, quorum rules, and split-brain handling.

Robots and AI devices that implement TS-R profiles can show **simple colour states** (red / yellow / green / blue) and generate receipts for high-stakes actions.

### 4.3 Receipts, anchoring, and Devora

Every high-value event can be captured as a **TruthSeal receipt**:

- Receipts use a standard schema (`ts.receipt.v1`) and include laws, metrics, context, and decisions.  
- Receipts are **post-quantum signed** (Dilithium-class) and **anchored** via **OpenTimestamps** or equivalent timestamping services.  
- The **TruthSeal Devora console** provides web reports, PDF exports, and a history of receipts for auditors and regulators.

All receipts ultimately feed into the TruthSeal ledger stack:

- **ULIC** — Universal Law of Infinite Coherence registry block,  
- **EVL** — Epoch Verification Ledger,  
- **Integrity Manifest**,  
- **QENC** — Quantum Ecosystem Closure ProofCapsule.

## 5. Who TruthSeal is for

- **Regulators and courts**  
  Need verifiable evidence, not promises. TruthSeal gives them receipts, hashes, and anchoring paths.

- **Hardware and accelerator vendors**  
  Want to ship GPUs and accelerators that are safe for governments, critical infrastructure, health, and finance. TS-A1 and coherence-grade certification provide that path.

- **Robotics manufacturers and integrators**  
  Need clear rules for when robots must stop, ask for help, or may act autonomously. TS-R1 and TS-R2 provide that law and telemetry.

- **Enterprises running high-stakes AI**  
  Banks, insurers, medical platforms, and infrastructure operators can use TruthSeal reports to understand their residual risk and to communicate it to boards and regulators.

## 6. Plans and tiers

### 6.1 Free — Baseline Coherence Check

- 1 coherence report per 24 hours per IP.  
- Core metrics: TCS v0.1 (Traykov Coherence Score) band, simple ACS view.  
- Noise Distiller Profile highlights hype vs signal in a short text or model output.  
- **No receipts or anchoring.**  
- Clear prompt in the UI: *“Upgrade to Pro for receipts and anchoring.”*

### 6.2 Pro — Deeper Reports and Receipts

- Expanded metrics: detailed TCS v0.1, ACS, and CHS summaries.  
- Access to selected profiles (Noise Distiller, Finance, first Philosophical Profiles).  
- PDF exports and **local receipts** for key events (no external anchoring by default).  
- Suitable for teams experimenting with coherence but not yet in full regulatory scope.

### 6.3 Enterprise — Full Law Stack

- Full access to metrics and profiles (including Hippocrates Profile where contractually allowed).  
- **Post-quantum signed, anchored receipts** for selected systems.  
- Integration with internal logging and governance tools.  
- Legal language and report formats designed for regulators, auditors, and insurers.  
- Robotics options (TS-R1) for customers with robots or embedded devices.

### 6.4 Network / Platform — Embedded TruthSeal

- For cloud, platform, and hardware vendors who want to embed TruthSeal into their own offerings.  
- White-label or “powered by TruthSeal” options.  
- Deep integration with TS-A1, TS-R1, and TS-R2.  
- Joint go-to-market and regulatory engagement.

## 7. Tone and style notes (for designers and copywriters)

- Always **expand acronyms the first time** they appear on a page.  
- Avoid political positioning and investment hype; focus on **evidence, receipts, and measurable coherence**.  
- Keep language human and direct — the aim is to make complex governance ideas feel understandable and actionable in minutes.
