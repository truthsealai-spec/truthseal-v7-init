# TruthSeal™ Certification Mark Usage Policy

## PREAMBLE — LEGAL EFFECT

This Policy defines the exclusive conditions under which the TruthSeal™ name, certification marks, seals, badges, references, and representations may be used.

TruthSeal™ marks are **governance instruments**, not marketing assets.

Any use of the TruthSeal™ mark constitutes a legal representation of verified compliance and triggers enforceable obligations under the Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework.

Unauthorized or incorrect usage constitutes misrepresentation.

---

## 1. DEFINITION OF THE MARK

The “TruthSeal™ Mark” includes, without limitation:

• The TruthSeal™ name and wordmark  
• Certification seals and badges  
• Textual claims of “TruthSeal Certified” or equivalent  
• Visual, digital, or embedded representations  
• References in documentation, marketing, or disclosures  

All variants are governed identically, regardless of medium.

---

## 2. GRANT OF MARK USAGE RIGHTS

Mark usage rights are:

• Explicit  
• Non-transferable  
• Non-sublicensable  
• Scope-limited  
• Time-bound  

No implied rights exist.

---

## 3. PERMITTED USES

Authorized entities may use the TruthSeal™ mark solely for:

• Identifying certified systems  
• Declaring verified governance compliance  
• Regulatory or investor disclosures  
• Internal compliance documentation  

Use must exactly match the certified scope.

---

## 4. PROHIBITED USES

The following are strictly prohibited:

• Marketing exaggeration or implication beyond scope  
• Use on uncertified systems or features  
• Use after suspension or expiry  
• Comparative or endorsement claims  
• Use implying legal personhood, rights, or autonomy  
• Use suggesting government or sovereign endorsement  

Prohibited use constitutes immediate breach.

---

## 5. FORMAT & PRESENTATION RULES

All mark usage must:

• Preserve original proportions and design  
• Include certification scope reference  
• Include validity status where applicable  
• Avoid visual dominance over core branding  

Alteration, stylization, or remixing is forbidden.

---

## 6. DIGITAL & EMBEDDED USE

For digital platforms and embedded systems:

• Mark usage must link to verification reference  
• Runtime display requires active certification state  
• Cached or static usage must reflect current validity  

Automated display without verification is prohibited.

---

## 7. PUBLIC STATEMENTS & DISCLOSURES

Any public reference to TruthSeal™ certification must:

• Be factual and scope-accurate  
• Avoid speculative or future claims  
• Avoid language implying endorsement  

TruthSeal™ reserves the right to require corrective disclosure.

---

## 8. MONITORING & AUDIT

TruthSeal™ actively monitors mark usage.

This includes:
• Public materials  
• Investor disclosures  
• Technical documentation  
• Digital interfaces  

Audit findings may trigger suspension or revocation.

---

## 9. ENFORCEMENT & REMEDY

Violations may result in:

• Immediate mark withdrawal  
• Certification suspension or revocation  
• Public notice of misrepresentation

Remedies are cumulative, not exclusive.

## 10. TERMINATION OF RIGHTS

Upon certification expiry, suspension, or revocation:

Failure to comply escalates enforcement.
