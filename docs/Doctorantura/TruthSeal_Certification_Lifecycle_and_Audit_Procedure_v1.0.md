# TruthSeal™ Certification Lifecycle & Audit Procedure

## PREAMBLE — LEGAL STANDING

This document defines the exclusive and binding lifecycle, audit authority, enforcement process, and revocation mechanics governing all TruthSeal™ certifications issued under the Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework.

This Procedure is a non-delegable governance instrument. No certification, mark, or representation of TruthSeal™ validity may exist outside the processes defined herein.

Certification under TruthSeal™ is not a declaration of ethics, intent, or best effort. It is a legally binding confirmation of structural compliance with irreversible governance constraints.

---

## 1. CERTIFICATION ELIGIBILITY

Certification eligibility is restricted to systems, organisations, or deployments that:

• Operate under explicit human accountability  
• Implement non-delegable responsibility attribution  
• Accept auditability as a permanent operational condition  
• Agree to immediate revocation upon breach  
• Waive claims of autonomous legal standing  

Experimental, research, or prototype systems may be granted limited-scope certification at the sole discretion of TruthSeal™ governance.

Eligibility does not imply approval. Eligibility permits audit initiation only.

---

## 2. CERTIFICATION LIFECYCLE OVERVIEW

The TruthSeal™ certification lifecycle consists of the following immutable stages:

1. Application Submission  
2. Pre-Audit Screening  
3. Formal Audit Execution  
4. Certification Determination  
5. Certification Issuance  
6. Continuous Compliance Monitoring  
7. Periodic Re-Audit  
8. Revocation or Renewal  

No stage may be bypassed, merged, or abbreviated.

---

## 3. APPLICATION & DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

Applicants must submit complete and truthful disclosure of:

• System architecture and deployment scope  
• Human control points and override mechanisms  
• Decision authority boundaries  
• Failure modes and fallback logic  
• Ownership and operational responsibility  

False disclosure constitutes immediate permanent disqualification.

---

## 4. AUDIT AUTHORITY

Audit authority is vested exclusively in TruthSeal™ or its explicitly appointed sovereign auditors.

Audit authority includes:

• Full inspection rights  
• Request for technical, legal, and operational evidence  
• Runtime observation  
• Historical log inspection  
• Incident reconstruction  

Refusal or obstruction constitutes automatic audit failure.

---

## 5. AUDIT EXECUTION STANDARD

Audits are conducted under a strict evidence-based standard.

Audit findings must demonstrate:

• Non-transferability of responsibility  
• Absence of autonomous legal or economic agency  
• Enforced human supremacy in decision escalation  
• Inviolable shutdown and override mechanisms  
• Non-political, non-sovereign operational posture  

Intent, policy language, or public statements are insufficient.

Only structural proof is admissible.

---

## 6. CERTIFICATION DETERMINATION

Certification outcomes are binary:

• CERTIFIED  
• NOT CERTIFIED  

Conditional, provisional, or partial certification does not exist unless explicitly defined in a written addendum issued by TruthSeal™ authority.

Certification determinations are final and non-appealable.

---

## 7. CERTIFICATION ISSUANCE & MARK CONTROL

Upon certification approval:

• A unique certification identifier is issued  
• Certification scope is explicitly bounded  
• Mark usage rights are granted per the Mark Usage Policy  
• Certification validity period is defined  

Certification does not transfer ownership, rights, or standing.

---

## 8. CONTINUOUS COMPLIANCE & MONITORING

Certification holders accept ongoing compliance obligations.

TruthSeal™ reserves the right to:

• Conduct unscheduled audits  
• Request incident disclosure  
• Require compliance attestations  
• Suspend certification pending review  

Compliance is a continuous condition, not a point-in-time event.

---

## 9. RE-AUDIT & RENEWAL

All certifications are subject to mandatory re-audit at intervals defined at issuance.

Failure to complete re-audit results in automatic expiration.

Renewal is discretionary and not guaranteed.

---

## 10. REVOCATION & SANCTIONS

Certification is immediately revoked upon:

• Material breach  
• Responsibility ambiguity  
• Undisclosed system evolution  
• Misuse of certification marks  
• Political, sovereign, or economic agency assertion  

Revocation is irreversible for the affected certification instance.

TruthSeal™ reserves the right to publish revocation notices.

---

## 11. DISPUTE EXCLUSION

Certification decisions are not subject to arbitration, litigation, or external review.

Participation constitutes full waiver of dispute rights.

---

## 12. GOVERNANCE FINALITY

This Procedure constitutes final operational law for TruthSeal™ certification governance.

No external policy, framework, or agreement may override its authority.
