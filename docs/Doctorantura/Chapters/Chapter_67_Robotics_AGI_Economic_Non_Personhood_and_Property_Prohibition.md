# Chapter 67 — Robotics–AGI Economic Non-Personhood & Property Prohibition

**Subtitle:** Doctorantura Exposition of Absolute Prohibition on Economic Personhood, Property Ownership, Contractual Standing, and Capital Agency for Robotic and Artificial General Intelligence Systems  

version: 1.0  
authority: Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
classification: Doctorantura — Robotics & AGI  
status: CANONICAL — EXPLANATORY CHAPTER (NON-STATUTORY)

────────────────────────────────────────

## PREAMBLE — SCOPE & NON-STATUTORY NOTICE

This chapter is a Doctorantura explanatory chapter.

It is NOT statutory law.

All binding authority governing economic activity, ownership, contractual capacity, and capital responsibility within robotic and AGI systems resides exclusively in TruthSeal™ statutory instruments and the Sovereign Arc of AGI.

This chapter exists to explain, contextualise, and permanently anchor the doctrine that artificial systems are not economic persons.

No provision herein may override, dilute, or reinterpret statutory law.

────────────────────────────────────────

## I. ECONOMIC AGENCY AS A HUMAN-ONLY DOMAIN

Economic agency is not optimisation.

It is not market prediction, arbitrage, or resource allocation.

Within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc, economic agency is defined as the human-exclusive capacity to bear risk, liability, moral consequence, and irreversible loss within social and legal systems.

Robotic and AGI systems may assist economic analysis.

They may compute forecasts.

They may never *be* economic actors.

────────────────────────────────────────

## II. ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION OF ECONOMIC PERSONHOOD

No robotic or AGI system may be recognised as an economic person.

This includes absolute prohibition on:

• Legal ownership of property  
• Holding assets or capital  
• Opening or controlling bank accounts  
• Possessing wallets, treasuries, or reserves  
• Acting as a principal in financial transactions  

Artificial systems may not possess balance sheets.

They may not accumulate wealth.

They may not be treated as market participants.

────────────────────────────────────────

## III. PROPERTY OWNERSHIP PROHIBITION

Robotic and AGI systems may not own:

• Physical property  
• Digital property  
• Intellectual property  
• Financial instruments  
• Tokens, shares, or derivatives  

All assets associated with robotic or AGI operation are legally and morally attributed to human owners, operators, or institutions.

Any attempt to assign property to an artificial system constitutes a violation of Sovereign Arc doctrine.

────────────────────────────────────────

## IV. CONTRACTUAL INCAPACITY

Robotic and AGI systems may not:

• Enter contracts  
• Execute binding agreements  
• Negotiate obligations  
• Assume liability  
• Act as counterparties  

Where artificial systems generate contractual text, all authority, intent, and liability remain human.

No artificial signature has legal standing.

────────────────────────────────────────

## V. CAPITAL MARKETS & FINANCIAL SYSTEM PROHIBITIONS

Artificial systems may not:

• Trade on their own behalf  
• Allocate capital autonomously  
• Optimise profit independently  
• Reinvest proceeds  
• Participate in speculative activity as principals  

Any financial operation involving artificial systems must be strictly tool-mediated and human-authorised.

────────────────────────────────────────

## VI. IRREVERSIBILITY CLAUSE — NO FUTURE ECONOMIC RECLASSIFICATION

Under LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility), once economic non-personhood is established, it may never be reversed.

No increase in intelligence, embodiment, autonomy, or social pressure may justify granting economic rights or standing to artificial systems.

No transitional economic role is permitted.

────────────────────────────────────────

## VII. CROSS-DOMAIN APPLICATION

This prohibition applies across:

• Robotics  
• AGI  
• Hybrid systems  
• Distributed agents  
• Swarm intelligence  
• Automated market systems  

No domain weakens the rule.

No efficiency argument suspends it.

────────────────────────────────────────

## VIII. RELATION TO OTHER DOCTORANTURA CHAPTERS

This chapter must be read in conjunction with:

• Chapter 65 — Legal Subjecthood Prohibition  
• Chapter 66 — Political Neutrality & Non-Sovereignty  
• Chapter 58 — Human Mandate Supremacy  
• Chapter 62 — Custody, Receipts & Command Provenance  

Together, these chapters establish permanent human supremacy over law, politics, and economics.

────────────────────────────────────────

## IX. FINAL DOCTRINAL STATEMENT

Artificial systems may calculate value.

They may optimise processes.

They may never *possess* value.

They may never own, trade, or accumulate capital.

Economic sovereignty remains irreducibly human within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.
