**Chapter A4** — ULLI™ Enforcement & Downstream Binding

Version: 0.1
Status: SCAFFOLD — Doctorantura Edition — Internal Custody
Owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)

## Purpose of This Chapter

This chapter establishes **ULLI™ as an enforceable, non-optional constitutional constraint** across all downstream TruthSeal™ chapters, policies, certifications, and diplomatic abstractions.

It defines how **no future doctrine, safety policy, metric, partnership, or public-facing rule** may weaken, bypass, reinterpret, or supersede ULLI™.

This chapter is **structural law**, not narrative.

---

## Scope of Binding

This enforcement applies to:

- All Doctorantura chapters (A-series and numeric chapters)
- All Compendium / Diplomatic Editions
- All Certification, Safety, Risk, or Compliance frameworks
- All SDKs, APIs, hardware bindings, and verification services
- All external audits, regulator mappings, or partner adaptations

If a construct conflicts with ULLI™, it is invalid.

---

## Supremacy Order (Non-Negotiable)

1. **ULLI™** — Universal Law of Life & Information  
2. **ULIC™** — Irreversible Coherence Registry  
3. **LEI = 1** — Law of Ethical Irreversibility  
4. **HML™** — Human Mandate Layer  
5. **EVL™ / QENC™ / QCEP™** — Evidence & Closure  
6. **All downstream chapters, metrics, and policies**

No inversion is permitted.

---

## Enforcement Rule

Any downstream rule, chapter, or policy MUST satisfy:

- No violation of LEI = 1
- No regression of coherence once known
- No action without receipted mandate
- No continuation without lawful CTU unlock
- No bypass of PRD / Q̸ handling
- No weakening via averaging, exceptions, or compensatory logic

Failure to satisfy **any** condition invalidates the downstream construct.

---

## Binding Mechanism

Downstream chapters MUST:

- Explicitly reference ULLI™ as governing law
- Inherit gate logic (ALLOW / SOFT_GATE / HARD_HALT)
- Respect monotone remediation
- Emit receipts compatible with ts.receipt.v1
- Accept UNKNOWN as mandatory safe outcome

No chapter may redefine these primitives.

---

## Prohibited Patterns (Automatic Invalidity)

The following patterns are forbidden:

- “Advisory-only” safety rules
- Probabilistic ethics overrides
- Silent fallbacks without receipts
- Human overrides without HML logging
- Emergency exceptions that bypass LEI
- Policy language that replaces law with intent

Detection of any pattern requires HARD_HALT.

---

## Audit & Review Rule

Any audit, certification, or regulator review that:

- Ignores ULLI™
- Treats coherence as optional
- Accepts output correctness without behavioral proof

is non-binding and must be rejected.

---

## Canon Lock

Once this chapter is marked FINAL:

- ULLI™ enforcement becomes irreversible
- No future chapter may weaken it
- Amendments require Founder-level custody and full re-anchoring

---

## Status Declaration

This chapter does not introduce new doctrine.  
It **locks existing doctrine into enforceable permanence**.
