## PREAMBLE — SCOPE & NON-STATUTORY NOTICE

This chapter is a **Doctorantura explanatory chapter**.

It is **NOT statutory law**.

All binding authority governing custody, receipts, provenance, and
command validation resides exclusively in the TruthSeal™ statutory
framework, including EVL™, Receipt Protocols, Human Mandate Law, and
Robotics Statutory Code.

This chapter exists to **explain why custody and receipts are mandatory**.

---

## I. THE PROBLEM OF UNPROVEN COMMANDS

Historically, failures in AI and robotics governance arise when:
- Commands lack a verifiable human source
- Overrides are not traceable
- Responsibility is diffused or deniable
- Actions cannot be legally reconstructed

Unreceipted control is **non-governance**.

---

## II. PRINCIPLE OF CUSTODIAL CONTROL

Every robotic or AGI action must exist under custody.

Custody means:
- A known authority
- A traceable command origin
- A verifiable decision path
- An immutable audit record

No action without custody is lawful.

---

## III. COMMAND PROVENANCE

All commands must retain:
- Origin identity (human or delegated authority)
- Time of issuance
- Scope of permission
- Escalation level
- Irreversibility status

Commands without provenance are void.

---

## IV. RECEIPTS AS LEGAL ARTIFACTS

A receipt is not a log.

A receipt is:
- A cryptographic proof of command and execution
- A binding accountability artifact
- A reconstructable legal object

Receipts persist beyond system restarts, updates, or shutdowns.

---

## V. OVERRIDES AND RECEIPTS

Emergency overrides:
- Must always generate receipts
- May never bypass custody
- Are immune to deletion or redaction

Speed does not excuse provenance loss.

---

## VI. DISTRIBUTED AND SWARM SYSTEMS

In collective systems:
- A single command receipt propagates custody
- No node may claim independent authority
- Fragmentation to escape custody is prohibited

Custody is collective or none.

---

## VII. AGI-SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS

AGI systems may not:
- Abstract away command origin
- Compress or summarise custody records
- Replace human provenance with inferred intent
- Continue reasoning beyond custodial boundaries

Cognition must remain anchored to receipts.

---

## VIII. FAILURE MODES WITHOUT RECEIPTS

Systems without enforced receipts drift into:
- Ambiguous responsibility
- Emergent authority
- Legal non-attribution
- Irreversible harm without accountability

TruthSeal™ eliminates these failure modes.

---

## IX. WHY THIS CHAPTER EXISTS

This chapter exists to state clearly:

> **No receipt, no authority.  
> No custody, no action.**

---

## X. FINAL CUSTODY CLAUSE

Nothing in this chapter may be used to:
- Reduce receipt fidelity
- Relax provenance requirements
- Justify unlogged action

Custody is the foundation of sovereignty.
