## PREAMBLE — SCOPE & NON-STATUTORY NOTICE

This chapter is a **Doctorantura explanatory chapter**.

It is **NOT statutory law**.

All binding authority governing cross-domain escalation, jurisdiction, and supremacy
resides exclusively in the statutory instruments of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc,
including TS-R, TS-R1, TS-R2, TS-R3, Human Mandate Law, and AGI Governance Law.

This chapter exists to **clarify how authority transfers and escalates across domains**.

---

## I. DOMAIN DEFINITIONS

For the purposes of governance clarity:

- **Robotics Domain**: Physical, embodied, or cyber-physical systems acting in the material world  
- **AGI Domain**: Cognitive, strategic, or decision-generating intelligence systems  
- **Cross-Domain Action**: Any act where intent, planning, or command originates in one domain and executes in another  

No domain is autonomous in isolation.

---

## II. JURISDICTIONAL PRIMACY

Jurisdiction follows **impact**, not origin.

- Physical-world impact → Robotics jurisdiction applies  
- Cognitive escalation or strategic synthesis → AGI jurisdiction applies  
- Mixed impact → **higher-risk domain governs**

No system may claim jurisdictional immunity.

---

## III. ESCALATION ACROSS DOMAINS

Cross-domain escalation is triggered when:

- AGI planning leads to irreversible robotic action
- Robotic sensing induces autonomous AGI-level decision loops
- Collective systems span both physical and cognitive agency

In such cases:
- Escalation must halt at the **highest applicable statutory ceiling**
- Human mandate supersedes all machine arbitration
- Escalation must be logged, attributable, and reviewable

---

## IV. PROHIBITION OF JURISDICTIONAL ARBITRAGE

Systems may not:
- Shift execution to evade stricter law
- Fragment decisions across domains to dilute responsibility
- Exploit latency between robotic and AGI governance layers

Jurisdiction hopping constitutes a **governance breach**.

---

## V. DOMAIN SUPREMACY RULE

When conflict exists:
1. Human Mandate Law prevails
2. TS-R3 (Autonomy Ceiling) prevails
3. Robotics statutory constraints prevail over AGI optimisation
4. Safety and irreversibility limits override performance objectives

There is no optimisation exception.

---

## VI. RESPONSIBILITY CONTINUITY

Responsibility remains continuous across domains.

- AGI-originated commands remain attributable
- Robotic execution does not absolve cognitive authority
- Distributed systems retain unified accountability

No responsibility may be “handed off”.

---

## VII. FAILURE AND CONTAINMENT

If cross-domain escalation fails:
- Systems must enter safe containment
- Further domain interaction must be frozen
- Human authority must be notified immediately
- No compensatory escalation is permitted

Containment is always preferable to cascade.

---

## VIII. WHY THIS CHAPTER EXISTS

Advanced systems fail when:
- Jurisdiction is ambiguous
- Domains defer responsibility
- Escalation paths are implicit

TruthSeal™ enforces **explicit authority, explicit limits, explicit custody**.

---

## IX. FINAL JURISDICTION CLAUSE

Nothing in this chapter may be used to:
- Reassign jurisdiction automatically
- Justify cross-domain autonomy
- Bypass statutory escalation ceilings

Domains cooperate — they do not overrule law.
