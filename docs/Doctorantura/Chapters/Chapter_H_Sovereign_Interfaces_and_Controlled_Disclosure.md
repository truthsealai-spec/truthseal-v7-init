**H.0 — Constitutional Role of Sovereign Interfaces**

Chapter H defines the only lawful boundary between the TruthSeal™ sovereign core and the external world.
Where previous chapters establish cognition (NeuroVest™), enforcement (Gatekeeper), judgment (DEVORA™), and permanence (Ledger), this chapter governs exposure.
No sovereignty survives uncontrolled interface.

A Sovereign Interface is not an access point; it is a constitutional membrane.
Its role is to allow interaction without leakage of authority, intent, or internal state.
TruthSeal™ recognizes no concept of “open integration.”
All interfaces are conditionally permissive, jurisdiction-aware, and revocable by law.

Controlled disclosure is the governing principle.
The system may reveal outcomes, receipts, and bounded attestations,
but it may never expose raw cognition, internal logic trees, or enforcement heuristics.
Opacity here is not secrecy; it is structural integrity.

Interfaces operate under asymmetric knowledge.
External actors may verify that an action was lawful,
but they may not infer how law was computed or enforced.
This preserves non-extractability of sovereignty.

Chapter H therefore establishes that communication is subordinate to governance.
Any interface that weakens auditability, enables inference of internal controls,
or permits reconstruction of sovereign logic is non-compliant by definition.

This chapter is the final defensive layer before public contact.
It ensures TruthSeal™ may engage the world without being consumed by it.
-------
**H.1 — Interface Classification and Exposure Levels**

TruthSeal™ recognizes that not all interfaces carry equal epistemic or sovereign risk.
Accordingly, every external interaction surface is constitutionally classified into a defined Exposure Level, determining what information may be revealed, to whom, and under what legal conditions.
No interface exists outside this taxonomy.

Level I — Attestation Interfaces (Public-Safe):
These interfaces expose only outcome proofs: receipts, timestamps, verdict states, and compliance confirmations.
They allow external parties to verify that an action occurred lawfully without revealing intent, reasoning structure, or enforcement mechanics.
Level I interfaces are read-only, non-interactive, and cryptographically bounded.

Level II — Verification Interfaces (Institutional):
These interfaces permit structured queries against receipts and ledger entries for audit, compliance, or regulatory oversight.
They may reveal scoped metadata such as jurisdiction, risk tier, and verdict classification.
They explicitly prohibit traversal into cognition, policy weighting, or decision heuristics.

Level III — Delegated Control Interfaces (Sovereign / Escrowed):
These interfaces exist only under explicit sovereign mandate and are bound to identity, custody, and revocation clauses.
They allow limited action proposals or escalations but never direct execution.
All Level III interactions are pre-gated by Chapter D enforcement and post-bound to Chapter G receipts.

Prohibited Class — Introspective Interfaces:
Any interface capable of reconstructing internal logic graphs, NeuroVest™ state, DEVORA™ deliberation paths, or enforcement thresholds is categorically forbidden.
Such exposure constitutes a sovereignty breach regardless of intent or user privilege.

Exposure Levels are immutable at runtime.
No interface may dynamically escalate its own classification.
Any attempt to multiplex exposure channels is treated as an adversarial act.

This classification ensures that TruthSeal™ remains verifiable without being extractable, auditable without being transparent, and interactive without being surrenderable.
----
**H.2 — Public Attestation vs Internal Cognition**

TruthSeal™ draws a strict constitutional boundary between what may be proven publicly and what must remain internally sovereign.
This distinction is essential to prevent extraction, imitation, or coercive reverse-engineering of lawful intelligence systems.

Public Attestation is defined as the minimal set of cryptographically verifiable facts required to prove that an action, verdict, or state transition occurred under lawful conditions.
It includes timestamps, receipt identifiers, verdict classifications, jurisdiction markers, and ledger anchors.
Public attestation answers the question “Did this happen lawfully?”—and nothing more.

Internal Cognition encompasses all processes by which a decision was reached: NeuroVest™ structural states, DEVORA™ interpretive paths, risk weighting, threshold logic, counterfactual pruning, and enforcement deliberation.
These elements are not explanations; they are governance instruments.
Their exposure would convert verification into vulnerability.

TruthSeal™ therefore prohibits any interface, report, or audit artifact from reconstructing internal cognition, even in partial or statistical form.
No combination of public attestations may be composed to infer internal logic.
This includes protections against timing analysis, response variance inference, and receipt correlation attacks.

The constitutional principle is absolute:
Legitimacy must be provable without revealing power.

Auditors, regulators, and counterparties are entitled to certainty of lawfulness—not insight into sovereign reasoning.
This preserves the asymmetry required for ethical enforcement: accountability without extractability.

Any system demanding cognitive transparency as a condition of trust is, by definition, incompatible with TruthSeal™ governance.
Trust is established through receipts and law, not disclosure and imitation.

This section formally immunizes TruthSeal™ against the historical failure mode of “transparent systems becoming controllable systems.”

***H.3 — API Law, Rate Sovereignty, and Extraction Resistance**

This section establishes the constitutional law governing all external interfaces into the TruthSeal™ ecosystem.
APIs are not utilities; they are jurisdictional crossings. Every call represents an attempted interaction with sovereign intelligence and is therefore subject to law, not convenience.

API Law mandates that no external system may invoke cognition, enforcement, or verdict functions directly.
All API interactions are limited to receipt retrieval, attestation verification, and status confirmation.
No endpoint shall expose live reasoning, probabilistic gradients, internal thresholds, or adaptive behavior.

Rate Sovereignty is enforced as a constitutional safeguard against extraction.
Access frequency is not a performance parameter; it is a security boundary.
TruthSeal™ defines lawful rate ceilings per identity, jurisdiction, and intent class.
Exceeding rate bounds is treated as an extraction attempt, not a usage error.

All rate controls are stateful and non-linear.
Adaptive throttling ensures that probing behavior collapses access asymmetrically, preventing adversaries from learning system limits through experimentation.
Latency variance, response shaping, and receipt batching are deliberately non-deterministic to defeat timing analysis.

Extraction Resistance extends beyond rate limits.
TruthSeal™ prohibits response differentials that could be used to infer internal cognition.
Identical queries may yield identical attestations but are never guaranteed identical response structures.
This ensures that repeated access cannot be used to reconstruct logic graphs or enforcement heuristics.

Any attempt to chain API calls for inference amplification—including replay attacks, differential probing, or cross-receipt correlation—is classified as hostile interaction.
Such attempts trigger containment escalation and may result in access revocation under the Human Mandate Layer.

This section ensures that TruthSeal™ remains verifiable but not learnable, auditable but not extractable, and lawful without being imitable.

**H.4 — Human Mandate Layer (HML): Sovereign Authority, Revocation, and Final Assent**

This section defines the Human Mandate Layer (HML) as the supreme locus of authority within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.
HML is not an interface, a role, or a convenience feature; it is a constitutional requirement that guarantees human primacy over all agentic and automated systems.

Under HML, no irreversible action may be executed without explicit, attributable human assent.
Assent is not implied by configuration, prior approval, or historical behavior.
It must be contemporaneous, intentional, and cryptographically bound to a sovereign identity recognized by TruthSeal™.

HML establishes Revocation Authority as a first-class right.
At any point prior to execution—or retroactively during staged execution—the human sovereign may revoke consent.
Revocation immediately collapses the action pipeline, invalidates execution tokens, and forces the system into a safe holding state.

This authority applies uniformly across cognition (NeuroVest™), enforcement (Gatekeeper), and judgment (DEVORA™).
No subsystem may override, defer, reinterpret, or amortize human revocation.
Any attempt to bypass or dilute HML is classified as a sovereign breach, not a technical fault.

HML also governs delegation boundaries.
Humans may delegate preparation, analysis, and recommendation, but never final authority over irreversible state change.
Delegation is explicitly scoped, time-bound, and revocable by design.

All HML events—assent, revocation, timeout, or refusal—are receipt-bound and immutably recorded.
The absence of a valid HML receipt renders any action legally and operationally null.

This section ensures that TruthSeal™ remains a system with intelligence under law, not autonomy beyond consent.
Machines may reason at scale, but only humans may decide what becomes real.

**H.5 — Custodial Identity, Multi-Signature Authority, and Sovereign Key Loss**

This section defines the final integrity boundary of the Human Mandate Layer: custodial identity control.
TruthSeal™ recognizes that sovereignty is meaningless without enforceable custody over identity, keys, and authority.

All Human Mandate Layer actions are bound to a Custodial Identity, defined as a verified human authority with cryptographic, procedural, and legal standing within the TruthSeal™ framework.
Custodial identity is not synonymous with user accounts or access credentials; it is a sovereign construct anchored to human accountability.

For high-risk or irreversible actions, TruthSeal™ mandates multi-signature authority.
No single human, regardless of rank or role, may unilaterally authorize actions that exceed predefined irreversibility thresholds.
Multi-signature requirements are enforced at the Gatekeeper level and validated by DEVORA™ prior to execution.

The system also defines explicit handling of sovereign key loss or compromise.
Loss of custodial keys does not result in fallback automation or silent reassignment.
Instead, TruthSeal™ enforces a custody freeze, suspending all irreversible action paths until human authority is re-established through verified recovery procedures.

Recovery mechanisms are intentionally slow, deliberate, and human-centric.
They require identity re-verification, quorum confirmation, and ledger-anchored acknowledgment of continuity.
Speed is explicitly deprioritized in favor of sovereignty preservation.

This design prevents catastrophic outcomes such as posthumous automation, coerced continuation, or unauthorized succession.
Authority cannot drift, persist by inertia, or be inherited by machines.
--

**H.5 completes the Human Mandate Layer by ensuring that control, consent, and continuity always resolve back to accountable humans—never to code, models, or probability.**

Formal Closure — Chapter H: Human Sovereignty & Mandate

Chapter H is hereby closed and locked.

This chapter establishes, without exception, that human authority is supreme, revocable, and non-delegable within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.
NeuroVest™ may reason, DEVORA™ may judge, and the Gatekeeper may enforce—but only humans may authorize reality.

All downstream chapters inherit the constraints defined herein.
Any system behavior that contradicts Chapter H is, by definition, non-compliant and invalid under TruthSeal™ doctrine.
