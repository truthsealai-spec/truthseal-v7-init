## 33.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 31 defined how authority is gained.  
Chapter 32 defined how authority is tiered and enforced.

This chapter defines **how authority is owned, exercised, frozen, and revoked by humans** in real operational systems.

The Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™) is the **civil custody interface** between:
- machine capability,
- legal accountability,
- and human sovereignty.

Without HML™, mandate tiers would exist only in theory.

---

## 33.1 The Custody Law (Non-Negotiable)

In TruthSeal™, mandate is treated as **custody**, not configuration.

This means:
- every mandate tier has a human owner,
- every elevation has a named authority,
- every override has a traceable decision,
- every emergency action leaves a receipt.

No system is permitted to:
- self-assign,
- self-extend,
- or self-interpret mandate.

---

## 33.2 WHY HML™ Must Exist (Failure Prevention)

Systems without a human custody layer fail in predictable ways:

1. **Self-Certification Failure**  
   The system becomes both actor and judge.

2. **Liability Collapse**  
   No human can be held responsible for outcomes.

3. **Override Resistance**  
   Intervention becomes slow, political, or impossible.

HML™ exists to block all three failure modes at once.

---

## 33.3 HML™ Roles (Doctorantura Canon)

HML™ is role-based, not individual-based.

### Mandate Custodian™

- Owns mandate tier and domain scope.
- Authorises elevation and revocation.
- Bears civil accountability.

---

### Safety Authority™

- May freeze or downgrade mandate immediately.
- Does not require prior approval in emergencies.
- Must justify action post-event via receipt.

---

### Audit Steward™

- Verifies receipt continuity.
- Confirms reconstruction viability.
- Flags integrity or provenance breaks.

---

### Policy Architect™

- Defines rule boundaries per mandate tier.
- Ensures policy compatibility with higher law.
- Cannot grant authority.

No single role may occupy all functions.

---

## 33.4 HOW HML™ OPERATES (MECHANICS)

### 33.4.1 Mandate Binding

At deployment, the system is bound to:
- a mandate tier,
- a domain certificate,
- a named Mandate Custodian™.

This binding is immutable at runtime.

---

### 33.4.2 Action Gating

Every significant action request passes through:
1. mandate tier validator,
2. domain scope checker,
3. coherence gate (TCS™, ACS™),
4. HML™ permission state.

Failure at any gate results in:
- refusal,
- receipt emission,
- optional escalation request.

---

### 33.4.3 Elevation Requests

An AGI may **request**, never assume, elevation.

A valid request must include:
- justification,
- risk assessment,
- scope limits,
- rollback plan.

HML™ may approve, constrain, or reject.

---

## 33.5 HOW Emergency Override WORKS

Emergency override is **authority-first, explanation-second**.

### Valid Triggers Include:
- behavioural drift,
- identity ambiguity,
- receipt pipeline failure,
- contradiction against core coherence laws,
- adversarial compromise indicators.

---

### Override Sequence:

1. **Freeze**  
   Halt execution within current mandate.

2. **Downgrade**  
   Revert to last safe mandate tier.

3. **Contain**  
   Restrict domain or capability surface.

4. **Halt**  
   Full operational stop if required.

Each step generates:
- an override receipt,
- a reason code,
- and a reconstruction trail.

---

## 33.6 Relationship to Mandate Tiers™

Mandate Tiers™ define **what is allowed**.  
HML™ defines **who allowed it and why**.

Together they ensure:
- authority is legible,
- escalation is lawful,
- rollback is instant,
- accountability is human.

---

## 33.7 Relationship to OPS™, ASA™, and DRS™

- **OPS™** determines when actions require receipts or refusal.
- **ASA™** operates only within HML™-approved bands.
- **DRS™** preserves the evidentiary chain.

HML™ authorises the envelope in which all three operate.

---

## 33.8 Canonical Statement

The Human Mandate Layer™ is the **sovereign governor of intelligence**.

TruthSeal™ does not remove human authority.  
It hardens it into a mechanical, auditable, and enforceable system.

## Chapter 33 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

Intelligence may advance.  
But authority remains human.

HML™ is the custody line that ensures
advanced systems never escape lawful civilisation.
