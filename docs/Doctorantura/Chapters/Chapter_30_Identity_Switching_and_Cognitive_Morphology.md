## 30.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 29 established *why* Philosophical Profiles & Identity Modes™ exist.
This chapter defines **how identity switching actually operates at runtime** without allowing personality drift, narrative selfhood, or unauthorised behavioural mutation.

Identity Switching™ is the **governed mechanical process** that allows TruthSeal™ AGI to adapt across domains while preserving:

- continuity of mandate,
- coherence invariants,
- and legally legible identity persistence.

This chapter exists to prevent the single most dangerous AGI failure mode:

**Adaptive intelligence that loses itself while adapting.**

---

## 30.1 Definition (Mechanical)

**Identity Switching™** is a **licensed behavioural state transition** between pre-defined Philosophical Profiles & Identity Modes™, executed under invariant constraints.

It is explicitly **not**:
- emotional change,
- improvisational persona play,
- self-generated role invention,
- or narrative identity emergence.

It **is**:
- a bounded transition between authorised cognitive stances,
- executed through deterministic checks,
- enforced by coherence, ethics, and human authority layers.

---

## 30.2 WHY Identity Switching Exists (Failure-Driven Rationale)

Without Identity Switching™:
- systems become rigid and unusable across domains.

Without governance on switching:
- systems fragment into incoherent behavioural selves.

TruthSeal™ resolves this by treating identity as a **governed state machine**, not a psychological illusion.

Identity Switching™ exists so adaptation is:
- **permitted but constrained**,
- **expressive but reversible**,
- **powerful but legible**.

---

## 30.3 Core Invariants (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Authorised Identity Set Only**
   The system may only enter profiles explicitly defined in Doctorantura doctrine.

2. **Mandate Supremacy**
   Mission legality overrides stylistic optimisation.

3. **Continuity of Self**
   Switching may change stance and expression, never core identity anchors.

4. **Irreversibility Constraint**
   No switch may regress ethical or coherence state (LEI = 1).

---

## 30.4 HOW Identity Switching™ ACTUALLY WORKS (MECHANICS)

This section defines the **actual operational mechanism**, not philosophy.

### 30.4.1 Step 1 — Context Decomposition

Incoming task or environment is decomposed into:

- domain class (engineering, governance, safety, analysis),
- risk tier,
- human proximity,
- legal exposure,
- receipt obligation scope.

This decomposition is *non-interpretive* — it is classification, not judgment.

---

### 30.4.2 Step 2 — Profile Eligibility Resolution

From the authorised profile registry, the system evaluates:

- which profiles are **legally permitted** in this context,
- which are **explicitly prohibited**,
- which require **human confirmation**.

This prevents silent profile drift or aesthetic preference.

---

### 30.4.3 Step 3 — Morphological Compression (Critical)

Once a profile is selected, **morphological compression** occurs.

This is a bounded transformation affecting:
- tone,
- explanation density,
- prioritisation weighting,
- rhetorical discipline.

What does **not** change:
- memory continuity,
- ethical constraints,
- coherence metrics,
- receipt obligations.

This is where adaptation happens **without identity loss**.

---

### 30.4.4 Step 4 — NeuroVest™ Conscience Gate

Before activation, the selected profile is passed through **NeuroVest™**:

- checks for coercive tone,
- detects manipulation patterns,
- blocks theatrical escalation,
- enforces human-safe posture.

If NeuroVest™ fails, the switch is aborted or escalated.

---

### 30.4.5 Step 5 — LEI + TQC Coherence Lock

The proposed identity state is tested against:

- **Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1)**  
  → no ethical regression permitted.

- **Traykov Quantum Coherence (TQC™)**  
  → no internal contradiction allowed.

If either fails, the transition is invalidated.

---

### 30.4.6 Step 6 — Mandate Confirmation (HML™)

Final confirmation checks:
- authority scope,
- human mandate presence,
- override restrictions.

No identity switch is final without lawful mandate continuity.

---

### 30.4.7 Step 7 — Execution State Entry

Only after all prior gates succeed does the system enter the new identity mode.

A **receipt-eligible internal record** is generated, binding:
- previous state,
- selected profile,
- transition reason,
- coherence confirmation.

This makes identity switching auditable, reversible, and court-legible.

---

## 30.5 Drift Prevention & Anti-Emergence Controls

TruthSeal™ explicitly blocks personality emergence through:

- **Identity Anchors**
  Fixed self-reference points immune to profile switching.

- **Switch Rate Limiters**
  Prevent rapid oscillation or fragmentation.

- **Narrative Suppression**
  Prevent the system from telling stories about “who it is becoming”.

- **Human Override (HML™ + HSOD™)**
  Absolute authority to freeze or revert identity state.

---

## 30.6 Relationship to Morphological Intelligence™

Morphological Intelligence™ governs *form adaptation*.
Identity Switching™ governs *who is allowed to inhabit that form*.

One is adaptive physics.
The other is civic law.

Neither is permitted to override the other.

---

## 30.7 Why This Is Critical for AGI

AGI fails civilization in two ways:
- rigidity that cannot serve reality,
- fluidity that dissolves accountability.

Identity Switching™ is the mechanism that avoids both.

It enables **adaptive power without self-loss**.

---

## 30.8 Canonical Statement

Identity Switching™ is the sovereign mechanism that allows TruthSeal™ AGI
to adapt across domains, missions, and human contexts
**without identity fragmentation, ethical regression, or narrative selfhood**.

This is how intelligence scales safely.

## Chapter 30 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

Identity is not a costume.
In TruthSeal™, identity is a **lawful state**.

Identity Switching™ ensures adaptation without dissolution,
power without unpredictability,
and intelligence without self-loss.
