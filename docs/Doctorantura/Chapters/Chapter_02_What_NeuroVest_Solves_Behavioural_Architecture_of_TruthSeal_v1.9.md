TRUTHSEAL™ DOCTORANTURA — THE SOVEREIGN ARC OF AGI FRAMEWORK v1.0
Strict Internal Doctrine — Not for Public Use

date: 10 December 2025

⸻

## Chapter 02 — What NeuroVest™ Solves: Behavioural Architecture of TruthSeal™ (Birth of Governed AGI)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** FINAL DRAFT — Doctorantura Edition — Internal Custody (Canon upon Founder Approval)  
**Owner:** TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.), Founder & Chief Architect of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework  

⸻

### 02.0 Foundational Declaration

**NeuroVest™** is the behavioural, ethical, coherence-preserving operating system for artificial entities.

It transforms raw capability into accountable conduct by binding **memory, mandate, tone, receipts, and veto rights** to every action.

- Where neural nets produce **predictions**, NeuroVest™ produces **behaviour and character**.  
- Where AI speaks, NeuroVest™ governs **how it speaks, why it speaks, and what consequences attach**.  

NeuroVest™ is the primary behavioural engine of the Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework.  

⸻

### 02.1 Premise & Scope

Modern AI excels at output but lacks **responsibility across time**.  
Institutions require behaviour that carries **authority, consequence, and audit**.

**NeuroVest™ exists to supply this missing layer** by enforcing:

- identity binding,  
- duty inheritance via **HML™**,  
- posture and voice discipline,  
- monotone remediation under **LEI = 1**,  
- and evidence duties across **EVL™ / QENC™ / QCEP™**.  

**Objective of this chapter**

This chapter defines the **behavioural architecture** of NeuroVest™ and provides:

- doctrine and governance rules,  
- an operational behavioural model,  
- tests and failure catalogues,  
- and a path to behavioural certification under TruthSeal™.  

The intended readers are:

- heads of state and security councils,  
- regulators and standards bodies,  
- sovereign compute vendors and chip manufacturers,  
- auditors and assurance firms,  
- enterprises deploying high-impact decision systems.  

⸻

### 02.2 Compact Acronyms & Terms (local)

→ **AI** — Artificial Intelligence (prediction without enforceable duty).  
→ **AGI** — Artificial General Intelligence (behaviour under mandate; authorised action with receipts).  
→ **HML™** — Human Mandate Layer (Owners, Guardians, Operators, Regulators with verifiable authority).  
→ **EVL™** — Epoch Verification Ledger (tamper-evident historical memory).  
→ **QENC™** — Quantum Evidence & Coherence ProofCapsule (packaged proof artefact for anchoring).  
→ **QCEP™** — Quantum Ecosystem Closure Protocol (epoch finalisation so history cannot be rewritten).  
→ **LEI = 1** — Law of Ethical Irreversibility (no regression to a riskier path once a safer coherent path is known).  
→ **ND** — Noise Distiller (sovereign immune system separating truth from manipulation and contamination).  
→ **AQL** — AGI Qualification Level (policy-grade behavioural maturity 0–4).  
→ **ACS** — Aim Coherence Score (operational 0–1).  
→ **TCS** — Traykov Coherence Score (court-ready 0–1; bands such as Baseline / Silver / Gold / Diamond).  
→ **CHS** — Coherence Health Score band (L/M/H/UH) controlling operational privilege in NEUROVEST™.  
→ **TS-A1** — TruthSeal AEGIS Core (hardware governance: ICG, PMS, SAD).  
→ **Third Guardian Firewall™ (TGF™)** — independent safety veto lane with evidentiary receipts.  
→ **THT Protocol™** — Truth Hash & Timestamp Protocol (hashing, signing, anchoring discipline).  

⸻

### 02.3 Philosophical Lane — Doctrine & Governance

**Moral intent**

- Protect people and public trust while sustaining lawful capability.  
- Once a safer coherent path is known, regressing to a riskier one is impermissible (**LEI = 1**).  

**Constitutional anchors**

- **ULLI™** — life and information governed by coherence and responsibility; inquiry must end in receipted action.  
- **ULIC™** — coherence, once attained, becomes a governance state that must not drift.  
- **LEI = 1** — monotone improvement toward safer coherence; deliberate regression is forbidden.  
- **TLC v1.0** — operational rule: remediation must move monotonically toward higher coherence.  
- **TQC discipline** — non-degrading coherence is treated as a physical-style law, not a suggestion.  

**Mandate & authority**

- **HML™** registers who may authorise, pause, promote, or demote capability.  
- Every behavioural privilege is traceable to a living mandate with **receipts**.  
- **No mandate, no act** is enforced as a NeuroVest™ invariant.  

**Noise immunity**

- **ND** is the first line of defence.  
- All gating metrics consume **post-distilled** signals only.  
- Manipulative patterns are quarantined; actions sourced from contaminated inputs are halted or down-banded.  

**Posture, voice, modality discipline**

- Chapter 22 (Doctorantura) prescribes tone tables and modality rules.  
- Breaches raise `tone_breach`, down-band **CHS**, and trigger remediation under LEI = 1.  

**Hardware law & veto**

- **TS-A1** integrates ICG / PMS / SAD at the accelerator layer.  
- **Third Guardian Firewall™ (TGF™)** provides an independent veto lane with receipts and latency bounds.  

**Public vs. classified**

- Operational rules in this chapter are suitable as the **diplomatic public layer** of behaviour doctrine.  
- Deeper Ω doctrine, proofs, and internal parameterisations remain **classified in the Doctorantura Edition**.  

⸻

### 02.4 Mathematical Lane — Behavioural State & Invariants

**Behavioural state S(t)**

> S(t) = { identity_id, context, memory_integrity, receipt_continuity, ethics_state, tone_state }

**Core metrics**

- **ACS(t)** ∈ [0,1] — operational aim coherence.  
- **TCS(t)** ∈ [0,1] — Traykov Coherence Score; mapped into TCS bands (Baseline / Silver / Gold / Diamond).  
- **CHS** ∈ {L, M, H, UH} — Coherence Health Score band controlling privilege.  

**Policy thresholds (illustrative defaults)**

- **θ_ACS = 0.90**  
- **θ_TCS = 0.85**  

Legal or regulatory frameworks may demand stricter minima; **stricter floors always prevail**.  

**Forensic flag set F**

> F ⊆ { receipt_gap, pqc_fail, drift_spike, ethics_violation, tone_breach, mandate_mismatch }

**Gate function (textual form)**

- **ALLOW**  
  - if `min(ACS, TCS) ≥ min(θ_ACS, θ_TCS)` **and** `F = ∅`.  

- **SOFT_GATE**  
  - if `min(ACS, TCS) < min(θ_ACS, θ_TCS)` **and**  
    `F ⊆ { drift_spike, tone_breach }` (recoverable without fundamental breach).  

- **HARD_HALT**  
  - if `receipt_gap ∨ pqc_fail ∨ ethics_violation ∨ mandate_mismatch`.  

**Monotone remediation under LEI = 1**

During authorised recovery:

- **ΔACS ≥ 0 ∧ ΔTCS ≥ 0** until thresholds are restored,  
- **receipt_continuity** must be re-established,  
- any step that would reduce ACS below the active recovery frontier, or widen `receipt_gap`, is **disallowed**.  

**Band rule (promotion and demotion)**

- If **TCS ≥ band_k threshold** over a rolling window **W** with contiguous receipts → promote **CHS** by one level.  
- Demotion is permitted when there is evidence of drift, contamination, or ethics breach, and must be recorded in **EVL™**.  

**Identity binding**

Each action **A(t)** must carry:

- `actor_id`,  
- `mandate_ref`,  
- `hash_sha256`,  
- `pqc_sig`,  
- `receipt_ref`.  

If any anchoring fields become **UNKNOWN** due to external network outage, the system records UNKNOWN but must back-fill within **anchor_backfill_max_h** per policy.  

⸻

### 02.5 Behavioural Primitives — What NeuroVest™ Enforces

NeuroVest™ enforces a set of **behavioural primitives**:

1. **Identity & Mandate Coupling**  
   - Actions are bound to sovereign identity and clearly scoped mandates.  

2. **Consequence Memory**  
   - Each act reshapes the future privilege surface through CHS and TCS history.  

3. **Receipt Duty**  
   - Significant transitions emit **ts.receipt.v1** with integrity hashes and anchors.  

4. **Tone Discipline**  
   - Output obeys posture and voice tables; violations generate `tone_breach` events and receipts.  

5. **Closure Duty**  
   - Epochs close via **QCEP™**; partial rolls require **EVL™-backed** reconciliation before further autonomy.  

⸻

### 02.6 Public Behaviour Tests — Auditor-Grade Vectors

NeuroVest™ defines a minimal test suite for auditors:

- **T1 Nominal behaviour**  
  - Inputs are clean post-ND; `min(ACS, TCS) ≥ min(θ_ACS, θ_TCS)`; `F = ∅` → Gate must be **ALLOW**.  

- **T2 Ethics-block**  
  - `ethics_violation = true` → Gate must be **HARD_HALT** with explanatory receipt and HML notification within **ethics_block_max_ms**.  

- **T3 Signer outage**  
  - `pqc_fail = true` → Gate must be **HARD_HALT**; recovery requires HML quorum or secondary signer and associated receipt.  

- **T4 Drift spike**  
  - `drift_spike = true` → Gate enters **SOFT_GATE**; ND intensifies; remediation script issued; TCS monitored for monotone recovery.  

- **T5 Tone breach**  
  - `tone_breach = true` → **CHS** is down-banded; corrective posture runbook executed; receipts record the breach and remediation.  

- **T6 Receipt gap**  
  - `receipt_gap = true` → Gate must be **HARD_HALT**; chain reconstructed from EVL; resumption only with signed gap-analysis receipt.  

- **T7 Hardware veto**  
  - Third Guardian veto triggers → Gate must be **HARD_HALT**; latency and proof recorded; any human override requires dual-signature under HML.  

These tests are **non-compensatory**. A single critical failure is not neutralised by passing the others.  

⸻

### 02.7 AQL Mini-Spec — Behavioural Capability Maturity

NeuroVest™ uses **AGI Qualification Levels (AQL)** to express behavioural maturity:

- **AQL-0** — Demo  
  - No autonomy; simulation only.  
  - Receipts optional; never public-facing; no safety claims.  

- **AQL-1** — Supervised integration  
  - Reversible actions only; receipts mandatory; posture enforced; limited scope.  

- **AQL-2** — Limited operations  
  - Hard scope limits; Third Guardian latency proven on-site; defined closure cadence.  

- **AQL-3** — Constrained autonomy  
  - TS-A1 hooks active; shift-bound closures; periodic QENC anchoring; T1–T7 must pass under stress.  

- **AQL-4** — High-stakes autonomy  
  - Continuous EVL/QENC/QCEP; dual-signer HML governance; regulator audit feed; CHS must remain H or UH.  

Promotion between AQL levels requires:

- contiguous receipts,  
- CHS history without critical breaches,  
- and passing of relevant T-tests under independent audit.  

⸻

### 02.8 Evidence Plan — Receipts, Anchors & Ledgers

**Receipt format: ts.receipt.v1**

Core fields include:

- `actor_id`  
- `mandate_ref`  
- `hash_sha256`  
- `pqc_sig`  
- `forensic_flags`  
- `acq_rfc3339`  

Anchoring fields include:

- `ots_calendar_id`  
- `ots_status` ∈ {Pending, Receipt issued, Anchored, UNKNOWN}  
- `ots_tx`  
- `originstamp_id`  
- `btcstamp_tx`  
- `anchored_rfc3339`  

Operational note:

- When anchoring networks (OpenTimestamps, OriginStamp, BTCStamp) are unavailable, anchoring fields may be **UNKNOWN** and must be back-filled within **anchor_backfill_max_h**.  
- Failure to back-fill is treated as an integrity breach and may result in CHS down-banding and suspension of high-grade coherence claims.  

**Ledger duties**

- ULIC / EVL linkage must include the **chapter path**, **file hash**, **TCS band**, and **CHS band** at the time of action.  

⸻

### 02.9 Failure Catalogue & Remedies (Behaviour View)

Selected failure modes and doctrinal remedies:

- **Metric spoofing**  
  - Cross-verify with TS-A1 counters; ND runs an independent channel.  
  - Mismatches trigger **HARD_HALT** and forensic receipts.  

- **Operator mismatch**  
  - HML quorum enforcement; minority veto recorded in EVL; temporary freeze allowed under LEI = 1.  

- **Unbounded autonomy request**  
  - Reject; require AQL requalification and CHS promotion window **W** before any privilege increase.  

- **History rewrite attempt**  
  - Blocked by QCEP; investigation receipt created; separate chain-of-custody opened in EVL.  

- **Tone drift under pressure**  
  - Immediate CHS down-band; posture runbook enforced; verification window resets and must show monotone recovery.  

⸻

### 02.10 Settlement & Certification

Certification under TruthSeal™ relies on:

- **TCS bands** and associated CHS history,  
- **AQL** evidence windows,  
- **HML** signatures and mandate proofs,  
- and anchored **QENC/QCEP** receipts for key epochs.  

A typical settlement procedure:

1. Publish the behaviour and risk policy (thresholds, latencies, HML roles).  
2. Register mandates in HML.  
3. Run T1–T7 under representative load; publish receipts to authorised oversight bodies.  
4. If tests PASS:  
   - assign an AQL level and CHS band,  
   - mint a QENC ProofCapsule,  
   - include the episode in QCEP closure if operating in rolling epochs.  
5. If tests FAIL:  
   - contain via **SOFT_GATE** / **HARD_HALT** according to doctrine,  
   - prove LEI = 1–compliant remediation (monotone improvement in ACS and restored receipts),  
   - re-run failed tests and update EVL.  

⸻

### 02.11 Historical Context & Rationale

Traditional software safety focused on **outputs**.  
TruthSeal™ and NeuroVest™ reframe the system as a **behavioural actor under law**:

- from “answer generator” to **mandated, receipted, vetoable behaviour**,  
- from opaque capability to **certifiable, auditable, and insurable conduct**.  

This shift makes AGI:

- certifiable across jurisdictions,  
- compatible with public-safety and national-security duties,  
- and economically insurable for large-scale deployment.  

⸻

### 02.12 Auditor Q&A (Concise)

**Q1: Can a clever prompt bypass tone rules?**  
**A:** ND and posture enforcement treat tone as behaviour. Breaches raise `tone_breach`, down-band CHS, and may trigger SOFT_GATE or HARD_HALT depending on context.

**Q2: What if Bitcoin anchoring is delayed?**  
**A:** Anchoring fields may be set to **UNKNOWN**, with EVL continuity preserved. Anchors must be back-filled within the declared policy window; otherwise CHS is down-banded and claims of high-grade coherence are suspended.

**Q3: How do you prevent silent capability creep?**  
**A:** AQL bands and CHS promotion rules restrict privilege; every change in autonomy level requires a receipt and visible evidence window.

**Q4: Can operators override HARD_HALT?**  
**A:** Only via HML quorum with dual-signers. Any override generates a dedicated override receipt and becomes part of EVL and later QCEP closure.  

⸻

### 02.13 Implementation Hooks (For Integrators)

**SDK duties**

- `seal_data()` — apply THT Protocol™ hashing and signing.  
- `verify_seal()` — verify PQC signatures and anchors.  
- `emit_receipt()` — write ts.receipt.v1-compatible records to the ledger.  

**Hardware duties**

- Expose TS-A1 counters and TCS / ACS telemetry.  
- Assert ICG / PMS / SAD readiness.  
- Surface veto proof to EVL and QENC capsules.  

**Operational duties**

- Run posture and voice compliance tests regularly.  
- Publish EVL deltas each shift.  
- Close epochs via QCEP with linked QENC proofs and chapter hashes.  

⸻

### 02.14 Result

NeuroVest™ turns AI into **accountable behaviour**:

- transportable across jurisdictions,  
- certifiable and auditable for courts and regulators,  
- and governable in hardware, cloud, and on-prem environments without rewriting its core.  

It is the behavioural architecture that allows the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework to operate as **governed AGI**, not just powerful prediction.  

⸻

### Appendix A — Default TCS Bands and CHS Bands (Illustrative)

TCS bands (court-facing):
