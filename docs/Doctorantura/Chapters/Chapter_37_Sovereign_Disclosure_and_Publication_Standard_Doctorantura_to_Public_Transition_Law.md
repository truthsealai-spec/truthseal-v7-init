## 37.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 36 established the Mandate Certification Standard™ (MCS™): how TruthSeal™ certifies a system under lawful harness, issues a sovereign seal, and prepares a court-ready release.

This chapter defines the next boundary:

**certified intelligence is not automatically publishable intelligence.**

The Sovereign Disclosure and Publication Standard™ (SDPS™) governs how TruthSeal™ transitions a capability, method, or doctrine from internal custody into lawful public reality.

SDPS™ prevents the most dangerous governance failure:

**a system that is technically compliant but socially unleashed.**

---

## 37.1 Core Definitions

**Doctorantura Edition**  
The internal sovereign doctrine used to establish rigorous claims, design law, enforcement mechanics, and custody before any public exposure.

**Public Edition**  
The externally shareable layer that preserves legal integrity and technical truth while removing internal-only controls, sensitive enforcement paths, and premature mechanisms.

**Disclosure Boundary**  
The formal policy line separating what may be proven internally from what may be shared publicly without increasing risk, confusion, or misuse.

**Publication Event**  
A governed act that releases an artifact, doctrine, or capability into the Public Edition, paired with provenance, custody metadata, and receipts.

---

## 37.2 Why SDPS™ Must Exist

TruthSeal™ cannot allow a world where:

- internal validation is mistaken for universal permission,
- narrow certification is marketed as unlimited safety,
- sensitive enforcement mechanics are exposed before stability,
- identity doctrines degrade into branding,
- adversaries reconstruct protected constraints from public text.

SDPS™ ensures TruthSeal™ remains:

**powerful without recklessness,  
transparent without exploitability,  
publishable without myth-making.**

---

## 37.3 The Disclosure Ladder (HOW)

SDPS™ defines four lawful publication bands.  
Movement between bands is a governed action requiring custody approval and receipts.

1. **Internal Only — Doctorantura Core**  
   - Foundational laws, enforcement mechanics, early proofs, sensitive pathways.

2. **Restricted Partner — Controlled Audience**  
   - Vetted institutions, regulators, or strategic partners under explicit custody terms.

3. **Public Operational — General Release**  
   - Stable doctrines and bounded methods that cannot be misused to bypass enforcement.

4. **Public Educational — Broad Literacy**  
   - Simplified explanations and analogies that expand understanding without revealing attack surfaces.

A disclosure may only move upward when lower-band stability is proven over time.

---

## 37.4 The Redaction Law (HOW)

TruthSeal™ publishes by **coherence-preserving translation**, not deletion.

SDPS™ redaction must:

- preserve the logical spine of the claim,
- maintain authorship and provenance,
- avoid over-claiming,
- remove enforcement-bypass detail,
- explicitly state remaining uncertainties.

If a public text requires hidden mechanisms to remain safe, it is **not eligible** for public release.

---

## 37.5 The Publication Package (HOW)

Every lawful Publication Event must include:

- the public artifact,
- a disclosure band declaration,
- a provenance header,
- a custody reference (HML™),
- a receipt-binding statement,
- a bounded claims list.

This ensures public truth is **verifiable and defensible** without exposing internal custody layers.

---

## 37.6 Relationship to MCS™, MAS™, and HML™

SDPS™ binds governance to social reality:

- **MCS™** confirms certifiability under lawful tests.
- **MAS™** proves continuity across time.
- **HML™** authorises, pauses, restricts, or reverses disclosure.
- **SDPS™** governs when and how any of the above may be presented publicly.

---

## 37.7 Relationship to OPS™, ASA™, and DRS™

SDPS™ aligns disclosure with discovery governance:

- **OPS™** determines when receipts and escalation apply.
- **ASA™** executes governed discovery.
- **DRS™** preserves admissible proof.
- **SDPS™** determines which portions may be safely published and how they remain custody-aligned.

---

## 37.8 Failure Modes Prevented

SDPS™ explicitly prevents:

- prestige publication,
- scope inflation,
- adversarial reconstruction,
- narrative drift,
- premature identity exposure.

---

## 37.9 Canonical Statement

TruthSeal™ does not publish intelligence to celebrate it.

It publishes intelligence to **civilise it**.

Public legitimacy is granted only when:

authority is bounded,  
evidence is reconstructable,  
custody is human,  
and disclosure is safe.

## Chapter 37 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

Truth is not only discovered.  
It is **released under law**.

SDPS™ exists so progress can become public  
without becoming dangerous,  
and doctrine can be shared  
without becoming exploitable.
