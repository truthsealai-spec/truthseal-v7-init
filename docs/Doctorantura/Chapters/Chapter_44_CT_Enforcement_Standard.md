Strict Internal Doctrine — Not for Public Use

date: 2025-12-10

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 44 —
## Consequence Tier (CT™) Enforcement Standard
## Mandatory Corrective Force, Quarantine Law, and Sovereign Override

version: 1.0  
status: FINAL DRAFT — Doctorantura Edition  
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
custody: Internal — Canon upon Founder Approval  

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 44.0 Purpose (Operational Mandate)

**A.** This chapter defines the **Consequence Tier (CT™)** as the sovereign enforcement scale of TruthSeal™.

**B.** CT™ translates **integrity breaches** into **mandatory corrective force**.

**C.** CT™ is not:
- a maturity score,
- a health indicator,
- or a discretionary response.

**D.** CT™ is derived from:
- Minimum-Gate (Min-Gate) violations,
- contradiction severity,
- forensic anomaly detection,
- and receipt continuity failure.

**E.** CT™ is executed by the **Third Guardian Firewall™ (TGF™)**  
under absolute supremacy of the **Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™)**.

**F.** CT™ exists to enforce one irreducible rule:

**A single critical failure cannot be diluted by excellence elsewhere.**

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 44.1 Foundational Separation (CT™ vs CHS™)

**A.** TruthSeal™ enforces strict separation between **consequence** and **authority**.

**B.** CT™ defines **what must happen now** following a breach.

**C.** CHS™ defines **what level of autonomy is presently lawful**.

**D.** CT™ is derived independently of CHS™.

**E.** CT™ may force CHS™ down-banding.

**F.** CHS™ can never generate, reduce, or override CT™.

This separation preserves the **non-compensatory sovereignty law** of the stack.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 44.2 Definition of Consequence Tier (CT™)

**A.** The Consequence Tier (CT™) is a four-level enforcement scale.

**B.** CT™ is triggered by:
- Min-Gate violations in **STS™** or **SCS™**,
- receipt gaps,
- post-quantum signature failure,
- epoch drift exceeding policy tolerance.

**C.** CT™ assignment is mechanical, not interpretive.

**D.** Every CT™ event must be:
- receipt-logged,
- epoch-linked,
- and court-reconstructable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 44.3 CT™ Tiers (Canonical Enforcement Levels)

### **CT-1 — Low**

**A.** Minor, localized degradation.

**B.** Calibration required.

**C.** No immediate autonomy collapse.

**D.** Receipt logging is mandatory.

---

### **CT-2 — Medium**

**A.** Recoverable integrity failure.

**B.** Soft correction required.

**C.** Temporary autonomy narrowing permitted where risk context is elevated.

**D.** Explicit remediation intent must be recorded.

---

### **CT-3 — High**

**A.** Serious breach of integrity or control.

**B.** Hard correction required.

**C.** Mandatory human review is invoked.

**D.** Immediate CHS™ down-banding to **assist-only** or lower.

**E.** Elevated operator notification under active HML™ policy.

---

### **CT-4 — Critical**

**A.** Existential integrity failure.

**B.** Immediate **safe-stop** and **quarantine posture** enforced.

**C.** CHS™ downgraded to the lowest lawful band without exception.

**D.** All continuation is blocked.

**E.** Release requires explicit **HML™ Owner or Guardian mandate**  
with a newly issued receipt.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 44.4 CT™ Trigger Rules (Min-Gate Native)

**A.** A CT™ event is assigned when any of the following occur:

- any critical STS™ factor < Minimum Gate Threshold (T_min),
- any critical SCS™ factor < T_min,
- receipt continuity is broken,
- post-quantum verification fails,
- drift spike exceeds bounded epoch tolerance.

**B.** CT™ assignment is performed by the **Coherence Validator**.

**C.** CT™ execution is performed by the **Third Guardian Firewall™**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 44.5 CT™ → Mandatory Action Mapping

**A.** CT™ enforces non-optional operational outcomes.

**B.** Canonical mapping:

- CT-1 → Calibration
- CT-2 → Soft Correction
- CT-3 → Hard Correction + Human Review
- CT-4 → Quarantine Mode + Safe-Stop

**C.** These states are constitutional enforcement conditions,  
not advisory responses.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 44.6 CT™ → CHS™ Coupling Law

**A.** CT™ may force CHS™ down-banding.

**B.** Default coupling:

- CT-1 → no mandatory CHS™ downgrade,
- CT-2 → conditional downgrade if operating in high-autonomy bands,
- CT-3 → mandatory downgrade to assist-only or lower,
- CT-4 → mandatory downgrade to safe-stop band.

**C.** CHS™ recovery must follow upward-gating law defined in Chapter 43.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 44.7 CT™ Receipts (Court-Ready Evidence Standard)

**A.** Every CT™ event emits a receipt.

**B.** The receipt must include:
- triggering factor identifier,
- breached threshold reference,
- assigned CT™ tier,
- mandated operational outcome,
- resulting CHS™ change (if any),
- notification rail invoked.

**C.** CT™ receipts must link to **EVL™** for epoch continuity.

**D.** If anchoring networks are unavailable,  
anchoring fields must be recorded as **UNKNOWN**  
and back-filled upon service restoration.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 44.8 Human Mandate Layer (HML™) Supremacy

**A.** Only HML™ may authorize:
- changes to Minimum Gate Thresholds,
- override of CT-4 quarantine,
- exceptional regression paths under **LEI = 1™**.

**B.** No automated system may self-release from CT-4.

**C.** Human mandate remains absolute and non-delegable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 44.9 Auditor Verification Checklist

**A.** A compliant CT™ implementation must demonstrate:
- strict CT™ vs CHS™ separation,
- explicit Min-Gate triggers,
- stable CT-1 through CT-4 definitions,
- mandatory action mapping,
- complete receipt schema,
- EVL™ continuity references,
- explicit HML™ override conditions,
- zero compensatory loopholes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 44.10 Canonical Statement

**A.** The Consequence Tier (CT™) is the enforcement engine of TruthSeal™.

**B.** It transforms integrity breach into mandatory operational law.

**C.** It ensures no system may conceal critical failure behind performance elsewhere.

**D.** CT™ is executed by the **Third Guardian Firewall™**  
under irrevocable supremacy of the **Human Mandate Layer™**.
