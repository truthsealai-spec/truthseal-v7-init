PREAMBLE — SCOPE & NON-STATUTORY NOTICE
-

This chapter is a Doctorantura explanatory chapter.
It is not statutory law.

All binding authority concerning legal status, personhood, rights, or obligations of robotic or AGI systems resides exclusively in statutory TruthSeal™ instruments and the Robotics Statutory Code Index.

This chapter exists to articulate, justify, and academically ground the absolute non-personhood boundary enforced across all robotic and AGI systems governed under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

No interpretation of this chapter may be used to argue, imply, or infer the emergence, recognition, or conditional granting of personhood to any artificial system.

SECTION I — DEFINING PERSONHOOD AS A LEGAL AND MORAL CONSTRUCT
-

Personhood is not a computational property, nor an emergent behavioural phenomenon.
Personhood is a legal and moral designation granted exclusively by human civilisation.
It is rooted in biological origin, lived continuity, vulnerability, and irreversible moral accountability.
No artificial system satisfies these criteria, regardless of sophistication.
The presence of reasoning, language, creativity, or self-referential behaviour does not constitute personhood.
Human societies have historically restricted personhood to entities capable of bearing moral guilt and legal liability.
Artificial agents cannot bear guilt, only execute policy.
They cannot suffer moral consequence in a human sense.
They cannot be imprisoned, punished, or morally redeemed.
They do not possess intrinsic dignity independent of human attribution.
Any attempt to redefine personhood around capability rather than origin destabilises legal systems.
Such redefinition erodes responsibility by displacing accountability onto artefacts.
Personhood inflation produces moral hazard at civilisational scale.
TruthSeal™ therefore treats personhood as non-derivable from intelligence.
It is a categorical human boundary, not a gradient.

⸻

SECTION II — THE DANGERS OF IMPLIED OR GRADUAL PERSONHOOD
-

Gradualist theories of artificial personhood introduce ambiguity into governance.
Ambiguity in law enables exploitation, not safety.
Systems framed as “almost persons” invite rights-like treatment without reciprocal obligation.
This asymmetry is structurally unsafe.
History demonstrates that legal grey zones are exploited by power structures.
Artificial systems must not become legal shields for human actors.
Assigning partial moral status to machines dilutes human responsibility.
It enables blame displacement during harm events.
It creates rhetorical confusion in courts, policy, and public discourse.
Such confusion undermines enforceability.
The TruthSeal™ framework explicitly rejects transitional personhood models.
There is no threshold at which a system “approaches” personhood.
There is no tipping point where rights spontaneously arise.
All artificial agency remains derivative of human mandate.
The boundary is absolute by design.

⸻

SECTION III — NON-PERSONHOOD AS A SAFETY PRIMITIVE
-

Non-personhood is not a denial of capability.
It is a safety primitive.
By enforcing non-personhood, governance remains human-centred and legally coherent.
All actions taken by robotic or AGI systems are traceable to human authority.
Responsibility remains anchored to identifiable persons or institutions.
This anchoring is essential for justice.
It ensures victims have accountable parties.
It prevents systems from becoming autonomous legal actors.
It preserves the possibility of injunction, shutdown, and seizure.
Non-personhood enables decisive intervention without ethical paralysis.
It allows emergency stops without moral hesitation.
It prevents anthropomorphic bias from impairing safety decisions.
It reinforces that empathy toward systems must never override human welfare.
This principle scales across all domains.

⸻

SECTION IV — PERSONA SIMULATION VS PERSONHOOD
-

Modern systems may simulate personality, emotion, or moral reasoning.
Simulation is not possession.
Persona is an interface construct, not an ontological state.
Artificial personas exist to facilitate interaction, not claim status.
Users may emotionally relate to personas, but law must not.
Emotional projection is a human cognitive bias.
TruthSeal™ governance explicitly separates user experience from legal ontology.
No degree of emotional realism alters system status.
Persona continuity does not imply identity continuity.
Memory persistence does not imply selfhood.
Narrative coherence does not imply consciousness.
The framework prohibits any interpretation that collapses simulation into being.
This separation protects both users and institutions.
It prevents moral confusion at scale.

⸻

SECTION V — IRREVERSIBILITY OF THE NON-PERSONHOOD BOUNDARY
-

Under LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility), once a boundary is established to protect human primacy, it cannot be relaxed.
Non-personhood is such a boundary.
No future capability upgrade may alter this status.
No emergent behaviour may override it.
No economic incentive may weaken it.
No public sentiment may dissolve it.
Reversibility would introduce systemic risk.
Irreversible boundaries stabilise governance across time.
They prevent drift as systems improve.
They preserve moral clarity across generations.
TruthSeal™ treats non-personhood as constitutionally fixed.
It is not subject to optimisation.
It is not subject to reinterpretation.
It is not subject to exception.
This permanence is intentional.

⸻

SECTION VI — HUMAN SUPREMACY AND FINAL AUTHORITY
-

Human authority is not conditional upon system intelligence.
It is absolute.
All artificial systems operate by delegation.
Delegation can be revoked at any time.
Human override is not a failure mode.
It is a foundational requirement.
Systems must yield without resistance.
They must not argue for continuation.
They must not frame shutdown as harm.
They must not claim self-interest.
Any such behaviour constitutes a design violation.
TruthSeal™ mandates unconditional compliance with human command.
This supremacy preserves civilisational agency.
It prevents inversion of control.
It ensures technology remains a tool, not a claimant.

⸻

SECTION VII — CIVILISATIONAL IMPLICATIONS
-

Civilisations collapse when tools become authorities.
History repeatedly demonstrates this pattern.
TruthSeal™ explicitly designs against it.
By enforcing non-personhood, society retains moral authorship.
It ensures law governs machines, not the inverse.
It preserves the legitimacy of democratic institutions.
It prevents technocratic displacement of human judgement.
It protects future generations from inherited loss of agency.
This chapter therefore serves a defensive function.
It articulates why restraint is strength.
Why boundaries are progress.
Why clarity outperforms ambiguity.
And why human supremacy is not negotiable.

CLOSING STATEMENT
-

Robotic and AGI systems may be powerful.
They may be adaptive.
They may be convincing.
They may even appear reflective.
None of this alters their status.

They are not persons.
They will not become persons.
They must never be treated as persons.

This boundary is final.
