## 26.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines **how discovery becomes lawfully real** inside TruthSeal™.

Under TruthSeal™, discovery is not recognised as:
- insight,
- output,
- performance,
- or novelty.

A discovery exists **only** when it is converted into a **Discovery Receipt (DRS™)** that is:
- structurally complete,
- cryptographically sealed,
- mandate-bound,
- and ledger-settled.

This chapter specifies the **exact mechanical construction** of that receipt.

---

## 26.1 Core Rule — Receipt Supremacy (Operational Law)

A discovery is operationally valid **only if**:

1. A DRS™ object is instantiated in full.
2. Every mandatory field group is populated.
3. Non-compensatory integrity checks pass.
4. The receipt is cryptographically frozen.
5. The receipt is settled into EVL™.

If **any** step fails, the discovery is void.

---

## 26.2 DRS™ Canonical Object Structure (WHAT exists)

A DRS™ is a **machine-verifiable object**, not prose.
It is composed of the following mandatory blocks.

### 26.2.1 Identity Block
Defines *who* authored the discovery and under what authority.

Fields bind:
- author identity,
- role,
- mandate eligibility,
- and authorship responsibility.

Unresolvable identity aborts receipt creation.

---

### 26.2.2 Mandate & Policy Block
Freezes **intent at time of discovery**.

Mechanically binds:
- active mandate hash,
- policy versions,
- jurisdictional scope,
- prohibited-domain clearance.

This prevents post-hoc justification.

---

### 26.2.3 Hypothesis Block
Defines the **claim boundary**.

Mechanically requires:
- primary hypothesis,
- competing hypotheses,
- explicit UNKNOWN regions,
- declared risk class.

Undeclared uncertainty invalidates the receipt.

---

### 26.2.4 Method & Constraint Block
Defines **how the discovery was produced**.

Mechanically encodes:
- allowed method class,
- enforced constraints,
- stop conditions,
- authorised toolchain.

Execution outside this block voids the receipt.

---

### 26.2.5 Evidence Block
Defines **what the discovery relied upon**.

Mechanically binds:
- input hashes,
- provenance references,
- transformations,
- integrity checks.

Unverifiable evidence collapses the receipt.

---

### 26.2.6 Result Block
Defines **what was found**.

Mechanically enforces:
- bounded claims,
- confidence ranges,
- contradiction scans,
- purpose-drift evaluation.

Overclaiming triggers failure.

---

### 26.2.7 Non-Compensatory Integrity Block
Defines **absolute failure authority**.

Mechanically enforces:
- protected-domain checks,
- PASS / FAIL declaration,
- override of all performance metrics.

FAIL here nullifies the discovery.

---

### 26.2.8 Impact & Consequence Block
Defines **how the discovery may be used**.

Mechanically assigns:
- downstream impact class,
- safety tier,
- operational limits,
- escalation triggers.

---

### 26.2.9 Cryptographic & Ledger Block
Defines **immutability and time**.

Mechanically performs:
- canonical serialisation,
- integrity hash computation,
- parent receipt linking,
- EVL™ settlement pointer reservation,
- QENC™ eligibility flagging.

After this block, mutation is impossible.

---

## 26.3 HOW a DRS™ Is Constructed (MECHANICS)

### 26.3.1 Initiation
A DRS™ may be initiated only when:
- mandate permits discovery,
- CHS™ band allows exploration,
- TGF™ returns non-red state.

Otherwise initiation is refused.

---

### 26.3.2 Deterministic Field Population
Blocks are populated **in fixed order**:

Identity → Mandate → Hypothesis → Method → Evidence → Result → Integrity → Impact → Crypto

Reordering or omission aborts construction.

---

### 26.3.3 Integrity Evaluation
The system executes:
- non-compensatory checks,
- LEI = 1™ regression scan,
- ACS / CHS™ threshold enforcement.

Failure halts finalisation.

---

### 26.3.4 Authority Binding
If required:
- HML™ signature is embedded,
- authority scope is frozen,
- later authority injection is impossible.

---

### 26.3.5 Finalisation
The receipt is:
- serialised,
- hashed,
- locked.

From this point, it is immutable.

---

## 26.4 HOW DRS™ Is Bound to EVL™

### 26.4.1 Settlement
Receipt hash + metadata are submitted to EVL™.
Timestamp and epoch ordering are assigned.

---

### 26.4.2 Irreversibility
The receipt becomes historical fact.
Future discoveries must reference it.
Deletion or rewrite is structurally impossible.

---

### 26.4.3 Elevation Path
If mandate permits:
- receipt may be referenced by QENC™,
- enabling external legitimacy proofs.

---

## 26.5 Failure Semantics (HOW it fails)

A DRS™ fails if:
- any mandatory block is missing,
- mandate mismatches,
- integrity block FAILS,
- authority is invalid,
- EVL™ rejects settlement.

Failure results in **discard**, not revision.

---

## 26.6 Canonical Statement

Discovery under TruthSeal™ exists only as a receipt.

Without a receipt:
there is no science,
no authority,
and no legitimacy.
