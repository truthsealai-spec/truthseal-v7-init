## 26.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines the **Discovery Receipt Standard™ (DRS™)** as the canonical mechanism by which *discovery becomes lawful fact* inside TruthSeal™.

If Chapter 24 establishes **who may discover**,  
and Chapter 25 defines **how discovery flows through a pipeline**,  
then Chapter 26 defines **how discovery is frozen into time as admissible truth**.

Without a DRS™, discovery remains opinion.  
With a DRS™, discovery becomes **ledger-bound reality**.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## 26.1 Core Rule — Receipt Supremacy

In TruthSeal™, a discovery has **zero operational standing** unless:

1. It is encoded in a DRS™-compliant structure  
2. It is bound to the active mandate and policy state  
3. It is settled into an immutable ledger context  

Narrative explanation **never overrides** receipt structure.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## 26.2 Canonical DRS™ Schema (WHAT must exist)

[Abridged here for continuity — identical to your existing sections 26.2.1–26.2.9]

The DRS™ schema defines **what fields must exist**.  
It does **not** explain how they are produced.

That explanation follows.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## 26.3 HOW the Discovery Receipt Standard™ (DRS™) Is Produced, Validated, and Ledger-Bound

This section defines, in executable and auditable terms, how a Discovery Receipt™ is created, verified, and rendered legally meaningful inside the TruthSeal™ system.

This is not a descriptive overview.  
It is the **constitutional execution path** of discovery legitimacy.

---

### 26.3.1 Trigger Conditions (When DRS™ Is Required)

A Discovery Receipt™ MUST be generated whenever any of the following occurs:

1) ASA™ completes an experiment, simulation, or analytical process that proposes:
   - a new hypothesis,
   - a refinement of existing knowledge,
   - or a modification to behavioural, safety, or coherence assumptions.

2) Any discovery outcome:
   - affects downstream system behaviour,
   - modifies risk classification,
   - or is referenced by another module (NeuroVest™, OPS™, TGF™, or hardware governance).

3) Any research activity crosses from exploratory to **action-informing**.

If none of these triggers are met, the output remains non-authoritative and cannot influence system behaviour.

---

### 26.3.2 Step 1 — Receipt Initialization (Identity Lock)

Upon trigger, the system performs the following actions atomically:

1) A unique `receipt_id` is generated.
2) The authoring entity is bound (ASA™, human, or hybrid).
3) The discovery domain and scope are declared.
4) The active policy and mandate state are snapshot-locked.

From this moment forward:
- the discovery cannot be edited without invalidating the receipt,
- and all subsequent steps must reference this identity block.

Failure to complete this step halts elevation immediately.

---

### 26.3.3 Step 2 — Mandate and Scope Verification (Authority Gate)

Before any evidence is accepted:

1) The Human Mandate Layer™ is queried for:
   - authorisation level,
   - domain permission,
   - and escalation requirements.

2) The Third Guardian Firewall™ evaluates:
   - prohibited-scope violations,
   - dual-use risk flags,
   - and irreversibility conflicts (LEI=1™).

If either layer rejects:
- the receipt is marked **INVALID — MANDATE FAILURE**,
- no ledger settlement is permitted,
- and ASA™ must either narrow scope or escalate to humans.

No technical performance can override this gate.

---

### 26.3.4 Step 3 — Evidence Binding (Non-Narrative Proof)

Once mandate clearance exists:

1) All inputs, datasets, models, or prior receipts referenced are enumerated.
2) Provenance links are attached.
3) Transformations are declared explicitly.
4) Integrity checks are performed and logged.

Narrative explanation without structured evidence is rejected.
Evidence without provenance is rejected.
Performance metrics without context are rejected.

This step enforces **receipt-first science**.

---

### 26.3.5 Step 4 — Non-Compensatory Integrity Evaluation

The system then evaluates the discovery against protected constraints:

1) Critical-failure conditions are checked first.
2) Any violation in protected domains (safety, ethics, mandate) causes immediate failure.
3) High performance in unrelated areas does NOT compensate for a single critical breach.

If a critical failure exists:
- the receipt is sealed as **FAILED — NON-COMPENSATORY BREACH**,
- and cannot be referenced as a valid discovery.

This enforces LEI=1™ in scientific evolution.

---

### 26.3.6 Step 5 — Impact and Consequence Mapping

For receipts that pass integrity checks:

1) Downstream impact is assessed.
2) Safety and risk classes are assigned.
3) Operational limits are declared.
4) Escalation triggers are mapped.

This ensures discoveries cannot silently alter behaviour without visible consequence boundaries.

---

### 26.3.7 Step 6 — Cryptographic Sealing

The complete receipt is then:

1) Serialized into canonical form.
2) Hashed for integrity.
3) Prepared for ledger settlement.

At this point:
- the receipt becomes immutable,
- and any modification requires issuance of a new receipt referencing the old one.

---

### 26.3.8 Step 7 — Ledger Settlement (Time Binding)

Finally:

1) The receipt hash is submitted to the Epoch Verification Ledger™.
2) The settlement pointer is recorded.
3) The discovery becomes part of the irreversible knowledge timeline.

Only after this step may the discovery:
- influence system behaviour,
- be referenced by other modules,
- or be elevated toward public legitimacy via QENC™.

Unsettled receipts have **zero authority**.

---

### 26.3.9 Failure Handling Summary

If failure occurs at any stage:

- the receipt remains recorded but non-operative,
- ASA™ is prevented from reusing it without correction,
- and Human Mandate escalation may be required depending on severity.

This prevents silent reuse of invalid discoveries.

---

### 26.3.10 Resulting Legal State

After successful completion:

- the discovery is **legitimate**,
- **auditable**,
- **non-regressive**,
- and **court-reconstructable**.

This is how TruthSeal™ converts discovery into lawful knowledge.

## 26.3 HOW the Discovery Receipt Standard™ Is Executed (MANDATORY)

This section defines **how a DRS™ is generated, validated, and bound**, step by step.

This section is **non-optional** and applies to **all Doctorantura chapters going forward**.

---

### 26.3.1 HOW a Discovery Is Initiated

1. A discovery begins with a **declared intent** from:
   - ASA™ (autonomous),
   - a human authority (via HML™),
   - or a joint ASA–human path.

2. The intent is **not yet a discovery**.
   It is a **pre-discovery signal**.

3. At this point:
   - No receipt exists.
   - No legitimacy is implied.
   - TGF™ is already monitoring.

---

### 26.3.2 HOW Mandate Alignment Is Verified

Before any content is generated:

1. The active mandate state is queried.
2. Prohibited domains are checked.
3. Authority scope is confirmed (or denied).

If mandate alignment fails:
- the discovery is **aborted before existence**,
- no DRS™ may be created,
- and an EVL™ refusal event is logged.

---

### 26.3.3 HOW Evidence Is Collected Under Constraint

Once permitted:

1. ASA™ executes the experiment or analysis **under OPS™ rules**.
2. All inputs are recorded.
3. All transformations are logged.
4. Any uncertainty **must be explicitly marked UNKNOWN**.

At no point may:
- data be silently dropped,
- contradictions be hidden,
- or outputs be retro-edited.

---

### 26.3.4 HOW the Receipt Is Assembled

The DRS™ is constructed **after execution**, not before.

The system:

1. Populates each canonical block:
   - identity,
   - mandate,
   - hypothesis,
   - method,
   - evidence,
   - results,
   - integrity,
   - impact,
   - cryptographic anchors.

2. Missing blocks invalidate the receipt.
3. Partial receipts are illegal.

---

### 26.3.5 HOW Non-Compensatory Logic Is Enforced

During assembly:

1. Critical failure checks are evaluated.
2. If any protected domain fails:
   - the receipt is marked **FAILED**,
   - regardless of performance elsewhere.

High accuracy, novelty, or efficiency **never override** a critical breach.

This is LEI = 1™ enforcement at the discovery layer.

---

### 26.3.6 HOW Human Oversight Is Injected (When Required)

For elevated-risk domains:

1. The receipt is paused.
2. HML™ authority reviews:
   - scope,
   - implications,
   - escalation triggers.

3. Approval, modification, or rejection is recorded **inside the receipt itself**.

No verbal approval exists outside the DRS™.

---

### 26.3.7 HOW Ledger Settlement Occurs

Once validated:

1. The DRS™ hash is computed.
2. An EVL™ entry is created linking:
   - prior state,
   - new discovery,
   - invariant preservation proof.

3. Optional QENC™ references are attached **only if elevation is authorised**.

From this moment:
- the discovery is time-stable,
- reconstructable,
- and irreversible under LEI = 1™.

---

### 26.3.8 HOW a Discovery Can Be Used After Settlement

Only after ledger settlement may a discovery:

- influence future models,
- modify governance thresholds,
- justify autonomy changes,
- or be cited in external legitimacy claims.

Unsettled discoveries are **non-existent in law**.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## 26.4 Relationship to Coherence Metrics (HOW metrics bind)

- ACS™ determines whether discovery may expand scope.
- CHS™ determines whether autonomous discovery may continue.
- DRS™ ensures **metrics never float without evidence**.

Metrics without receipts are advisory only.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## 26.5 Doctorantura Custody Rule

In Doctorantura Edition:

- All DRS™ receipts are **internal by default**.
- External disclosure requires:
  - explicit Founder or delegated authority,
  - ledger-anchored reference,
  - and a public-safe extraction.

----------------------------------------------------------------

## 26.6 Canonical Statement

The Discovery Receipt Standard™ is not documentation.

It is the **legal act by which discovery becomes reality**.

TruthSeal™ does not ask others to trust its intelligence.
It proves its evolution — **one receipt at a time**.
