## A.0 Purpose of Constitutional Sealing

**Purpose.** This chapter performs a constitutional sealing function over DEVORA™ as a defined doctrinal component of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.  
**Scope.** It establishes fixed meaning, bounded authority, and immutable limits without asserting completion of the Sovereign Arc itself.  
**Non-Closure.** This chapter does not declare arc completion, endpoint finality, or termination of the broader framework.  
**Function.** The sealing enacted here prevents semantic drift, reinterpretation, or authority inflation across future epochs.  
**Continuity.** DEVORA™ remains operational within its defined role under previously established doctrine.  
**Level.** This act operates strictly at the doctrinal and constitutional layer, not at implementation or deployment level.  
**Jurisdiction.** The sealing applies uniformly across legal, technical, academic, and institutional contexts.  
**Intent.** Meaning is preserved without halting lawful evolution of surrounding systems.  
**Constraint.** No future expansion may be inferred from performance, capability, or convenience.  
**Stability.** The purpose is preventative, not transformative.  
**Authority.** This chapter binds interpretation to sovereign intent.  
**Permanence.** Once sealed, meaning may be referenced but not altered.  
**Integrity.** The act ensures DEVORA™ remains intelligible to human sovereignty.  
**Protection.** Misuse through abstraction or partial citation is precluded.  
**Finality.** The sealing is deliberate, explicit, and durable.

## A.1 Constitutional Fixation of Meaning

**Fixation.** All meanings attributed to DEVORA™ in prior doctrine are hereby fixed and immutable.  
**Reference.** Interpretation is bound to recorded sovereign intent, not future commentary.  
**Constraint.** No semantic expansion, reframing, or contextual dilution may occur.  
**Uniformity.** This fixation applies equally across jurisdictions and languages.  
**Independence.** Meaning is independent of implementation details or technical form.  
**Clarification.** Explanatory material may evolve; authoritative meaning may not.  
**Boundary.** Paraphrase does not confer reinterpretation rights.  
**Consistency.** Educational or derivative material must align exactly with this fixation.  
**Protection.** The fixation guards against academic or regulatory drift.  
**Stability.** DEVORA™ retains identical meaning across time.  
**Authority.** Only sovereign amendment may alter this fixation.  
**Exclusivity.** No third party may claim definitional authority.  
**Continuity.** Prior meanings are preserved, not replaced.  
**Legitimacy.** This fixation preserves legitimacy under LEI = 1.  
**Closure.** The meaning set is complete and closed.

## A.2 Irreversibility of Functional Separation

**Principle.** DEVORA™ is constitutionally confined to interpretive intelligence.  
**Separation.** Irreversible enforcement remains exclusively external to DEVORA™.  
**Non-Merger.** No system may lawfully merge interpretation with enforcement.  
**Constraint.** Performance gains do not justify recombination of roles.  
**Irreversibility.** This separation cannot be relaxed by future capability.  
**Protection.** Ethical irreversibility depends on this structural boundary.  
**Enforcement.** Any violation renders a system non-compliant by definition.  
**Clarity.** DEVORA™ never executes physical or electrical actions.  
**Balance.** Authority is preserved through separation, not concentration.  
**Resilience.** The structure resists coercive optimization.  
**Immunity.** Post-quantum advances do not alter this rule.  
**Consistency.** The separation applies across all deployments.  
**Guardrail.** The rule prevents autonomous escalation.  
**Legality.** Compliance is mandatory, not optional.  
**Finality.** This separation is permanently binding.

## A.3 Epoch Stability and Non-Rollback

**Epoch Stability.** DEVORA™ is declared stable across technological epochs.  
**Non-Rollback.** No future transition permits rollback of defined limits.  
**Immunity.** Capability increases do not grant expanded authority.  
**Continuity.** The doctrine persists unchanged through paradigm shifts.  
**Constraint.** Optimization pressure cannot override constitutional limits.  
**Durability.** The role survives hardware, software, and architectural change.  
**Consistency.** Evolution may occur around DEVORA™, never within it.  
**Preservation.** Meaning is preserved without freezing innovation.  
**Protection.** The doctrine resists reinterpretation under stress.  
**Universality.** Epoch changes do not weaken obligation.  
**Stability.** This ensures long-term governance coherence.  
**Integrity.** The system remains legible to oversight.  
**Non-Negotiable.** No exception pathway exists.  
**Authority.** Epoch immunity is sovereignly declared.  
**Finality.** The rule is permanent.

## A.4 Custody and Amendment Authority

**Custody.** Sovereign custody of DEVORA™ doctrine resides exclusively with its author.  
**Authority.** Amendment authority is singular and non-delegable.  
**Procedure.** Any modification requires explicit sovereign declaration.  
**Form.** Amendments must be issued as new Doctorantura chapters.  
**Anchoring.** All amendments require receipt anchoring via THT.  
**Ledger.** Changes must be recorded in the Epoch Verification Ledger.  
**Invalidity.** Absent these steps, all deviations are void.  
**Protection.** This prevents silent or implicit change.  
**Clarity.** Custody is unambiguous and recorded.  
**Integrity.** Authority cannot be inferred or assumed.  
**Continuity.** Custody persists across institutional change.  
**Finality.** Amendment rules are fixed.  
**Legitimacy.** This preserves constitutional trust.  
**Sovereignty.** Control remains human and explicit.  
**Closure.** Custody is sealed.

## A.5 Prohibition of External Reinterpretation

**Prohibition.** No external entity may redefine DEVORA™.  
**Restriction.** Partial extraction or derivative standards are forbidden.  
**Equivalence.** Claims of functional equivalence are invalid without certification.  
**Translation.** Non-authoritative translations hold no doctrinal force.  
**Protection.** This guards against regulatory or vendor overreach.  
**Academic Use.** Citation does not confer reinterpretive rights.  
**Integration.** Integration must preserve exact meaning.  
**Boundary.** Marketing language may not alter doctrine.  
**Enforcement.** Violations constitute doctrinal breach.  
**Clarity.** Authority remains singular.  
**Consistency.** Meaning remains unified globally.  
**Prevention.** Drift is structurally blocked.  
**Integrity.** The doctrine remains intact.  
**Legitimacy.** Sovereign control is preserved.  
**Finality.** External reinterpretation is barred.

## A.6 Doctrinal Finality Statement

**Finality.** DEVORA™ is sealed as a non-evolving doctrinal component.  
**Authority.** Its role, limits, and meaning are complete.  
**Continuity.** Future chapters may reference but not alter this doctrine.  
**Integrity.** The sealing preserves coherence across the Sovereign Arc.  
**Legibility.** The system remains intelligible to human oversight.  
**Constraint.** Power remains bounded by meaning.  
**Stability.** The doctrine resists erosion.  
**Trust.** Finality strengthens institutional confidence.
