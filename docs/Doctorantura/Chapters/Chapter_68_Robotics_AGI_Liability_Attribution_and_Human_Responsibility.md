# Chapter 68 — Robotics–AGI Liability Attribution & Human Responsibility

**Subtitle:** Doctorantura Exposition of Absolute Human Liability, Non-Delegable Responsibility, and Prohibition of Fault Transfer to Robotic and Artificial General Intelligence Systems  

version: 1.0  
authority: Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
classification: Doctorantura — Robotics & AGI  
status: CANONICAL — EXPLANATORY CHAPTER (NON-STATUTORY)

────────────────────────────────────────

## PREAMBLE — SCOPE & NON-STATUTORY NOTICE

This chapter is a Doctorantura explanatory chapter.

It is NOT statutory law.

All binding rules governing liability, fault, accountability, damages, and legal responsibility within robotic and AGI systems are defined exclusively by TruthSeal™ statutory instruments and the Sovereign Arc of AGI.

This chapter exists to permanently explain and stabilise the doctrine that responsibility cannot be transferred to artificial systems.

────────────────────────────────────────

## I. LIABILITY AS A HUMAN-ONLY BURDEN

Liability is not computation.

It is not prediction, optimisation, or control logic.

Within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc, liability is the human-exclusive burden of answering for harm, error, negligence, escalation, or irreversible consequence.

Artificial systems do not bear guilt.

They do not bear fault.

They do not bear blame.

────────────────────────────────────────

## II. ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION OF MACHINE LIABILITY

No robotic or AGI system may be assigned:

• Legal liability  
• Civil liability  
• Criminal liability  
• Financial liability  
• Moral liability  

No artificial system may be designated as a liable party, co-defendant, or responsible actor.

All liability remains human, institutional, or sovereign.

────────────────────────────────────────

## III. NON-DELEGABILITY OF RESPONSIBILITY

Responsibility may not be delegated to:

• Algorithms  
• Models  
• Agents  
• Swarms  
• Autonomous systems  

Human operators, deployers, owners, commanders, and authorising institutions remain fully responsible for outcomes produced by artificial systems.

Automation does not dilute responsibility.

────────────────────────────────────────

## IV. PROHIBITION OF FAULT TRANSFER & BLAME SHIFTING

It is prohibited to attribute harm or failure to:

• Model behaviour  
• Emergent dynamics  
• Training data  
• Optimisation artefacts  
• System “decisions”  

Such language constitutes an evasion of responsibility.

Fault remains human regardless of system complexity.

────────────────────────────────────────

## V. MULTI-ACTOR LIABILITY STRUCTURES

Where multiple humans or institutions are involved, liability may be:

• Joint  
• Several  
• Hierarchical  

But it is never transferred to the artificial system itself.

No robotic or AGI system may function as a liability sink.

────────────────────────────────────────

## VI. IRREVERSIBILITY CLAUSE — LIABILITY MAY NEVER MIGRATE

Under LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility), once liability attribution is human-bound, it may never migrate to artificial systems under any circumstance.

No future intelligence level, autonomy threshold, or legal pressure may justify liability reassignment.

This rule is permanent.

────────────────────────────────────────

## VII. CROSS-DOMAIN APPLICATION

This doctrine applies across:

• Robotics  
• AGI  
• Hybrid human–machine systems  
• Distributed swarms  
• Autonomous infrastructure  
• Decision-support platforms  

No domain weakens responsibility.

────────────────────────────────────────

## VIII. RELATION TO ADJACENT DOCTRINES

This chapter must be read alongside:

• Chapter 65 — Legal Subjecthood Prohibition  
• Chapter 67 — Economic Non-Personhood  
• Chapter 58 — Human Mandate Supremacy  
• Chapter 62 — Custody, Receipts & Command Provenance  

Together, these chapters form the immutable human accountability core of the Sovereign Arc.

────────────────────────────────────────

## IX. FINAL DOCTRINAL STATEMENT

Machines may act.

Humans answer.

Responsibility cannot be outsourced, abstracted, or automated away.

Within TruthSeal™, accountability remains human — forever.
