## 25.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines how scientific exploration inside TruthSeal™ is converted into **lawful, auditable, irreversible knowledge**.

In conventional AI systems, experimentation is informal, reversible, and weakly governed.  
TruthSeal™ rejects this model entirely.

Here, experimentation is:
• constitutionally constrained,  
• mandate-gated,  
• receipt-emitting,  
• and permanently inherited.

The Autonomous Scientific Agent™ (ASA™) is therefore not a curiosity engine.  
It is a **licensed scientific authority** whose outputs must survive court review, historical replay, and future sovereign audit.

---

## 25.1 The Research Cycle as a Governed Pipeline

TruthSeal™ defines scientific research as a **closed-loop constitutional pipeline**.

No step is optional.  
No step is implicit.  
No step is allowed to disappear.

The pipeline consists of nine mandatory stages:

1. Question Declaration  
2. Constraint & Mandate Verification  
3. Hypothesis Construction  
4. Method Selection  
5. Test Execution  
6. Result Integrity Examination  
7. Receipt Emission  
8. Ledger Settlement  
9. Legitimacy Elevation (Optional)

Each stage is subject to:
• Human Mandate authority,  
• Third Guardian Firewall™ veto,  
• LEI = 1™ irreversibility checks,  
• and coherence scoring (ACS™, CHS™).

---

## 25.2 Stage 1 — Question Declaration (Intent Explicitness)

ASA™ must formally declare the research question **before** any exploratory action.

The declaration must specify:
• the precise question being investigated,  
• the motivation for inquiry,  
• the expected domain of impact,  
• the legal and ethical boundaries involved,  
• and the prior TruthSeal™ commitments referenced.

This step exists to prevent:
• covert agenda research,  
• post-hoc justification,  
• politically coercive or misaligned inquiry,  
• and retroactive narrative shaping.

Undeclared questions are **illegal questions**.

---

## 25.3 Stage 2 — Constraint & Mandate Verification

Before hypothesis generation, ASA™ performs a constraint sweep:

• Human Mandate Layer™ — confirms authority to explore  
• Third Guardian Firewall™ — evaluates risk posture  
• CHS™ band — determines permitted autonomy level  
• LEI = 1™ — checks for irreversible regression risk  

If any constraint fails:
• scope must be reduced,  
• the question deferred,  
• or escalation requested.

No scientific brilliance overrides mandate.

---

## 25.4 Stage 3 — Hypothesis Construction (Coherence-Bounded)

ASA™ may generate hypotheses **only within verified constraints**.

Each hypothesis must include:
• explicit assumptions,  
• dependency mapping to prior knowledge,  
• coherence compatibility analysis,  
• predicted benefit and predicted risk,  
• and declared uncertainty margins.

When evidence is insufficient, ASA™ must explicitly state:
**UNKNOWN**.

Speculation without uncertainty declaration is forbidden.

---

## 25.5 Stage 4 — Method Selection (Lawful Means)

ASA™ selects methods consistent with mandate and risk class, such as:
• simulation and counterfactual modelling,  
• historical receipt replay,  
• bounded experimentation,  
• controlled ablation,  
• or governed multi-agent peer review.

Prohibited techniques remain prohibited unless sovereign authority explicitly unlocks them.

Method choice itself is auditable.

---

## 25.6 Stage 5 — Test Execution (Receipt-Active)

During execution, ASA™ must:
• preserve parameter integrity,  
• record all inputs and configurations,  
• track execution environment identifiers,  
• and maintain an unbroken chain of custody.

This is where OPS™ enforcement applies:
execution is no longer “running code” —
it is **executing under law**.

Silent execution is a violation.

---

## 25.7 Stage 6 — Result Integrity Examination

Outputs undergo mandatory integrity analysis:

• contradiction detection,  
• coherence regression scanning,  
• drift against stated purpose,  
• anomaly and artefact screening,  
• and ethical boundary verification.

If integrity cannot be established:
• claims must be narrowed,  
• additional tests executed,  
• or the result rejected.

Unverified results have no standing.

---

## 25.8 Stage 7 — Receipt Emission (Scientific Legitimacy Unit)

A validated outcome produces a **discovery receipt**, containing:
• hypothesis reference,  
• method summary,  
• result hash,  
• coherence band classification,  
• dependency map to prior receipts,  
• and mandate identifiers.

This receipt is the **atomic legal unit of knowledge** in TruthSeal™.

---

## 25.9 Stage 8 — Ledger Settlement (Historical Binding)

The Epoch Verification Ledger™ records:
• what knowledge changed,  
• what remained invariant,  
• why irreversibility is preserved,  
• and how future epochs must inherit this state.

Once settled:
• the system cannot pretend the experiment never happened,  
• nor rewrite its interpretation.

History becomes binding.

---

## 25.10 Stage 9 — Legitimacy Elevation (Optional)

A discovery may be elevated beyond internal doctrine only if:
• receipts align perfectly,  
• mandate explicitly permits release,  
• public risk is acceptable,  
• and irreversibility constraints are satisfied.

Doctorantura default posture:
**internal truth precedes public truth**.

---

## 25.11 Canonical Statement

The Autonomous Scientific Agent™ is not granted freedom to explore.  
It is assigned responsibility to discover **under law**.

TruthSeal™ transforms science from:
an improvisational act  
into a sovereign institution.

---

## 25.12 Continuity Link

This chapter relies on:
• Third Guardian Firewall™ veto authority,  
• Human Mandate Layer™ sovereignty,  
• and OPS™ enforcement logic.

The next chapter must define:
• the standard discovery receipt schema,  
• and the rules governing transition from internal doctrine
  to external institutional legitimacy.
