## DECLARATION OF FINALITY

This document certifies that the **Robotics–AGI Doctorantura Arc is complete**.

All doctrinal, legal, ethical, and governance boundaries governing Robotics and Artificial General Intelligence are fully defined, indexed, and sealed.

No further chapters, addenda, interpretations, or extensions are permitted within this arc.

────────────────────────────────────────

## SCOPE OF THE SEAL

This seal applies globally and irreversibly to:

• Robotics systems  
• Artificial General Intelligence systems  
• Hybrid robotic–cognitive agents  
• Autonomous, semi-autonomous, and supervised systems  

It applies regardless of jurisdiction, deployment context, or technological substrate.

────────────────────────────────────────

## EFFECT OF THE SEAL

Upon sealing:

• Governance scope is closed  
• Interpretive drift is prohibited  
• Expansion by implication is void  
• Authority remains exclusively human  

Any attempt to bypass, reinterpret, or weaken the sealed boundaries constitutes a governance breach.

────────────────────────────────────────

## RELATION TO PRIOR CHAPTERS

This seal does not modify prior chapters.

It confirms them.

Chapters 1–71 remain authoritative, complete, and binding within their defined scope.

────────────────────────────────────────

## FINAL STATEMENT

Governance ends where ambiguity begins.

This arc ends here.
