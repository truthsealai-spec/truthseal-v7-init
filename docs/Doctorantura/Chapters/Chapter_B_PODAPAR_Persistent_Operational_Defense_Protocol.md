Chapter B — PODAPAR™ (Persistent Operational Defense & Action Protocol)

Doctorantura Edition — Internal / Sovereign

⸻

**B.0 Purpose & Scope**

PODAPAR™ is a persistent operational defense protocol embedded inside a sovereign system.
It operates continuously, without sleep, pause, or discretionary downtime.
Its purpose is to detect, constrain, and respond to hostile, anomalous, or unsafe conditions.
PODAPAR™ does not reason ethically.
PODAPAR™ does not interpret authority.
It executes bounded operational defense under strict rules.
The protocol applies to software systems, hardware systems, and hybrid deployments.
It functions before, during, and after higher-level intelligence activity.
PODAPAR™ is not event-driven only; it is state-driven.
It exists even when no action is requested.
It is always active while the system is alive.
Its scope includes telemetry, inputs, transitions, and outputs.
It does not depend on external trust.
It assumes adversarial conditions by default.
It is designed for real-time environments.
It is hardened for post-quantum threat models.

⸻

**B.1 Definition** (What PODAPAR™ Is)

PODAPAR™ is a deterministic watchdog protocol.
It enforces a fixed operational cycle: Patrol → Observe → Detect → Analyse → Protect → Act → Report.
Each phase has explicit entry and exit conditions.
No phase may be skipped.
No phase may override another.
PODAPAR™ operates below interpretive intelligence layers.
It does not generate goals.
It does not modify policy.
It does not negotiate outcomes.
It enforces safety through mechanical constraint, not judgment.
PODAPAR™ accepts only receipt-bound authorisation.
It rejects ambiguous or stale signals.
It treats silence as risk.
It treats inconsistency as threat.
It is designed to fail closed, not open.
It is always subordinate to sovereign authority.

⸻

**B.2 Operational Cycle** (HOW It Runs — 24/7)

Patrol continuously scans system surfaces and internal state.
Observe samples telemetry, inputs, timing, and behavioural signals.
Detect flags deviations from expected bounds or signatures.
Analyse classifies deviations using fixed, auditable criteria.
Protect applies containment rules before any execution occurs.
Act executes only if authorised and safe conditions are satisfied.
Report records the full chain of events immutably.
After Report, the cycle restarts automatically.
This loop never terminates during system uptime.
Cycle timing is bounded and deterministic.
Latency thresholds are enforced per phase.
Missed deadlines trigger quarantine.
State corruption triggers quarantine.
Cryptographic failure triggers quarantine.
Human override is not implicit.
All actions are reversible only if policy allows.

⸻

**B.3 Cryptographic & Control Mechanics** (HOW Safety Is Enforced)

PODAPAR™ uses post-quantum cryptographic primitives.
Session establishment uses ML-KEM (Kyber or successor).
Authorisation tokens are signed with ML-DSA (Dilithium class).
Hashes use SHA-3 or equivalent quantum-resistant functions.
Short-TTL tokens bound each Act transition.
Expired tokens are rejected without retry.
Patterns are encoded at the edge using a Pattern Codec.
Raw patterns never leave the edge.
Only HMAC-sealed representations are transmitted or stored.
Replay detection is mandatory.
Dictionary versions are pinned and time-bounded.
Stale references invalidate execution.
Keys are stored in HSM/TPM custody.
Key exfiltration attempts trigger isolation.
No cryptographic shortcut exists.
Failure defaults to restraint.

⸻

**B.4 Reporting, Ledger & Audit** (HOW Evidence Is Preserved)

Every Report produces an immutable event record.
Each record includes previous hash linkage.
Event hashes are chained sequentially.
Time beacons are authenticated.
Device identity hashes are embedded.
Authorisation token IDs are logged.
Reports are signed post-quantum.
Ledger commits occur immediately on fault.
Batching is allowed only in stable operation.
Quarantine events force instant commit.
Reports are human-readable and machine-verifiable.
No report may be deleted.
No report may be edited.
Redaction requires sovereign process.
Audit reconstruction is always possible.
Evidence survives system shutdown.

⸻

**B.5 Failure, Quarantine & Escalation** (HOW It Stops Harm)

PODAPAR™ treats failure as a governed state.
On violation, the system enters QUARANTINE.
Execution halts automatically.
External calls are blocked.
State transitions are frozen.
Reports are finalised and sealed.
No recovery occurs inside the same authority context.
Escalation requires explicit sovereign mandate.
Silent failure is impossible.
Partial execution is forbidden.
Rollback occurs only if explicitly permitted.
Otherwise, isolation persists.
Repeated violations escalate severity.
Cross-system propagation is blocked.
Human operators receive verified notice.
No ambiguity is tolerated.

⸻

**B.6 Deployment Characteristics**

PODAPAR™ runs inside the system, not beside it.
It cannot be disabled at runtime.
It cannot be bypassed by software updates.
It is independent of business logic.
It scales from single device to swarm.
Latency is bounded and predictable.
Resource usage is controlled.
It survives partial system degradation.
It does not rely on cloud trust.
It supports air-gapped environments.
It is compatible with post-quantum migration paths.
It is neutral to application domain.
It protects finance, infrastructure, and autonomy systems.
It is designed for hostile environments.
It never sleeps.
It never assumes safety.

⸻

**Canonical Statement**

PODAPAR™ is the watchdog that never sleeps.
It ensures that action never outruns safety.
It exists to prevent harm through execution, not interpretation.
It is mechanical, bounded, and sovereign by design.

⸻

**Canonical Notice**

PODAPAR™ is a sovereign operational defense protocol.
Its meaning, scope, and mechanics are fixed at the doctrinal level.
No implementation, vendor claim, or external standard may redefine or weaken this protocol.

This chapter is binding across all TruthSeal™-certified systems.
