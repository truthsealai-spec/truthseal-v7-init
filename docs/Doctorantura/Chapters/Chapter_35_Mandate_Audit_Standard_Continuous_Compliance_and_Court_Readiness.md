## 35.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 34 defined how authority is enforced, revoked, and lawfully rolled back.

This chapter defines **how mandate legitimacy is continuously proven over time**.

The Mandate Audit Standard™ (MAS™) is the permanent verification layer that ensures:
- authority remains bounded after enforcement,
- governance rules are executed as-written,
- receipts remain reconstructable,
- and court readiness is preserved at all times.

MAS™ exists because **authority without continuous audit inevitably decays into narrative**.

---

## 35.1 Definition of Mandate Audit

A Mandate Audit is a structured, repeatable evaluation confirming that a TruthSeal™ governed system:

1. operates within its authorised mandate tier,
2. obeys escalation, refusal, and override rules,
3. generates valid receipts when required,
4. remains reconstructable under dispute or review.

This is not a ceremonial review.
It is **living proof that the mandate still exists in reality**.

---

## 35.2 Audit Domains

MAS™ evaluates the entire governance surface, including:

- Operational Prompts Standard™ (OPS™) rules governing lawful action.
- Discovery workflows executed under authorised mandate bands.
- Receipt integrity across discovery, refusal, escalation, and enforcement.
- Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™) custody and override decisions.
- Mandate Enforcement & Revocation™ (MER™) rollback and intervention history.

These domains are inseparable.
Failure in one weakens admissibility in all.

---

## 35.3 Audit Triggers

MAS™ may be initiated by:

- scheduled institutional or sovereign cadence,
- mandate elevation, downgrade, or re-banding,
- behavioural anomaly or drift signal,
- formal dispute or challenge,
- regulatory, judicial, or partner request.

In TruthSeal™, audit is not suspicion-driven.
It is **the default condition of lawful intelligence**.

---

## 35.4 Required Evidence Package (HOW)

A complete MAS™ evidence bundle includes:

- current mandate tier and authority band declaration,
- governing OPS™ rule set for that band,
- representative executed decisions,
- receipt sets covering discovery, refusal, escalation, and enforcement,
- HML™ custody and approval trail,
- MER™ intervention and restoration records (if applicable).

If any decision cannot be reconstructed,
**it cannot be treated as sovereign truth**.

---

## 35.5 Audit Outcomes

MAS™ produces one of three outcomes:

### Pass
Mandate is provably respected with complete receipts.

### Conditional Pass
Mandate is respected, but documentation or receipt density requires correction within a defined window.

### Fail
Mandate execution cannot be proven.
Authority must be constrained, paused, or rolled back until audit integrity is restored.

MAS™ prevents permission creep from becoming institutional risk.

---

## 35.6 Court Readiness Checklist (Doctorantura)

A mandate is court-ready only when it demonstrates:

- stable identity and custody attribution,
- explicit authority scope at time of action,
- cryptographic continuity of receipt chains,
- clear linkage to governing rules,
- repeatable reconstruction by an independent party.

Court readiness is not confidence.
It is **structure under scrutiny**.

---

## 35.7 Relationship to OPS™, ASA™, DRS™, HML™, and MER™

MAS™ binds the governance stack into continuity:

- OPS™ defines when audit and receipts are mandatory.
- ASA™ executes discovery inside authorised mandate bands.
- DRS™ preserves discovery and governance admissibility.
- HML™ remains the human custody authority.
- MER™ executes immediate enforcement and rollback.
- MAS™ proves that this entire system remains real over time.

MAS™ is the law that prevents governance from becoming symbolic.

---

## 35.8 Canonical Statement

TruthSeal™ does not prove authority once.

It proves authority continuously.

Mandate Audit Standard™ ensures that
power remains visible,
governance remains legible,
and intelligence remains lawful.

It is proven continuously.

and power never escapes custody.
