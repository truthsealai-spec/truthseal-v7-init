## PREAMBLE — SCOPE & NON-STATUTORY NOTICE

This chapter is a **Doctorantura explanatory chapter**.

It is **NOT statutory law**.

All binding authority governing swarm autonomy, escalation thresholds, collective decision-making, and irreversible-action limits resides **exclusively** in the statutory file:

`docs/doctorantura/robotics/TS-R3_Swarm_Autonomy_Ceiling_v1.0.md`

This chapter exists solely to explain, contextualise, and academically ground **TS-R3** within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI.

No provision in this chapter may override, reinterpret, dilute, or substitute statutory robotics law.

---

## I. POSITION OF TS-R3 WITHIN THE ROBOTICS STATUTORY HIERARCHY

TS-R3 establishes the **absolute autonomy ceiling** for all fleet, swarm, and collective robotic systems governed under TruthSeal™.

Within the binding hierarchy:

1. **TS-R — Global Robotics Law** defines sovereign robotics law  
2. **TS-R1 — Single Robot Operational Profile** defines unit-level lawful capacity  
3. **TS-R2 — Fleet & Swarm Operational Profile** governs collective coordination  
4. **TS-R3 — Swarm Autonomy Ceiling** imposes non-negotiable limits on collective autonomy, escalation, and irreversible action  

TS-R3 is not a coordination profile.  
It is a **hard ceiling**.

When invoked, TS-R3 supersedes TS-R2 for all autonomy, escalation, and irreversible-action thresholds.

---

## II. WHY A SWARM AUTONOMY CEILING IS NECESSARY

Collective robotic systems introduce risks that **do not exist at the single-agent level**, including:

- Emergent decision-making beyond individual intent  
- Distributed responsibility dilution  
- Escalation through aggregation rather than intent  
- Irreversible outcomes arising from coordination speed or scale  

TS-R3 exists to ensure that **scale does not create new lawful capacity**.

A swarm may never do collectively what **no single robot could lawfully do alone**.

---

## III. AUTONOMY VS COORDINATION — A CRITICAL DISTINCTION

TS-R3 draws a strict line between:

- **Coordination** (permitted under TS-R2)  
- **Autonomy amplification** (restricted by TS-R3)

Coordination allows:
- Task distribution  
- Redundancy  
- Efficiency gains  

Coordination does **NOT** allow:
- Increased decision authority  
- Expanded legal agency  
- Collective override of unit-level constraints  

TS-R3 ensures that coordination never becomes a backdoor to autonomy escalation.

---

## IV. ESCALATION & IRREVERSIBLE ACTION THRESHOLDS

TS-R3 governs all scenarios involving:

- Collective escalation of force, motion, or authority  
- Actions that cannot be safely reversed once initiated  
- Distributed decisions with real-world legal, ethical, or safety impact  

At these thresholds:

- Autonomy must halt or degrade  
- Human mandate or higher-order governance must intervene  
- No optimisation, averaging, or consensus mechanism may bypass limits  

This reflects **LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility)**:  
Once a safety, legal, or ethical boundary applies, it applies **irreversibly and collectively**.

---

## V. FAILURE MODES & SAFE DEGRADATION

TS-R3 presumes failure as a design reality.

Therefore, it enforces:

- Conservative defaults under uncertainty  
- Safe halt or graceful degradation over escalation  
- Prohibition of “majority vote” autonomy under risk  

A swarm under ambiguity must **reduce autonomy**, not increase it.

---

## VI. RELATIONSHIP TO TS-R1 AND TS-R2

TS-R3 does not replace TS-R1 or TS-R2.

Instead:

- TS-R1 defines the **maximum lawful capacity of any single robot**  
- TS-R2 governs how multiple robots coordinate within those limits  
- TS-R3 ensures that **no collective behaviour exceeds those limits**

Any attempt to treat TS-R3 as optional, conditional, or situational constitutes a statutory violation under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

---

## VII. DOCTORANTURA INTERPRETIVE NOTE

This chapter is intentionally explanatory rather than prescriptive.

Its purpose is to:
- Make TS-R3 legible to regulators, auditors, engineers, and scholars  
- Prevent misinterpretation of swarm autonomy as emergent permission  
- Reinforce that **law precedes optimisation**

TruthSeal™ does not regulate robots by performance.  
It regulates them by **lawful capacity**.

---

## VIII. FINAL NON-DEROGATION CLAUSE

Nothing in this chapter may be used to:
- Authorise swarm behaviour  
- Certify autonomy  
- Justify deployment  
- Override statutory constraints  

Only the statutory TS-R files carry legal force.

Detachment of TS-R3 from the Robotics Statutory Code Index constitutes a breach of TruthSeal™ law and LEI = 1.
