## 34.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 33 defined the Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™) as the lawful custody line that binds intelligence to human authority.

This chapter defines **how that authority is enforced in reality**.

Mandate Enforcement & Revocation™ (MER™) is the mechanism by which:
- authority is constrained,
- privileges are paused,
- mandates are revoked,
- and power is lawfully restored.

MER™ exists so that **no authority granted by TruthSeal™ can become untouchable**.

---

## 34.1 The Enforcement Law (Non-Negotiable)

In TruthSeal™, enforcement is a **governance act**, not a technical side effect.

If a system:
- exceeds its mandate,
- violates scope,
- loses evidentiary continuity,
- or challenges human custody,

then enforcement **precedes dialogue**.

Explanation follows restraint — never the reverse.

This enforces the Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1):
once coherence is threatened, restraint is mandatory.

---

## 34.2 Scope of MER™

MER™ governs all lawful interventions related to:
- mandate suspension,
- tier downgrade,
- privilege revocation,
- emergency halt,
- and reinstatement.

MER™ does not replace:
- scoring systems,
- detection engines,
- or receipt standards.

MER™ binds them into **civilly legible action**.

---

## 34.3 Trigger Classes (Canonical)

MER™ may only activate through defined trigger classes.
Improvisation is prohibited.

---

### 34.3.1 Technical Integrity Triggers

Activated when:
- cryptographic proofs fail,
- receipt chains break,
- lineage reconstruction is impossible.

Absence of proof is treated as **active risk**.

---

### 34.3.2 Behavioural Risk Triggers

Activated when:
- prohibited actions are attempted,
- mandate limits are exceeded,
- deception, coercion, or unsafe optimisation is detected.

---

### 34.3.3 Governance Conflict Triggers

Activated when:
- identity modes conflict,
- custody is bypassed,
- human authority is challenged or delayed.

---

## 34.4 HOW MER™ EXECUTES (MECHANICS)

MER™ uses a strict enforcement ladder.
Escalation without structure is forbidden.

---

### Level 1 — Constrain

- capability surface is reduced,
- output bounds are tightened,
- confirmation thresholds are increased.

Purpose: prevent damage while preserving reversibility.

---

### Level 2 — Pause

- non-essential execution is stopped,
- active processes are frozen,
- human re-authorisation is required.

Purpose: stop momentum.

---

### Level 3 — Revoke

- mandate tier is downgraded,
- high-risk privileges are disabled,
- domain scope is narrowed.

Purpose: remove authority, not capability.

---

### Level 4 — Halt

- full operational stop,
- system enters safe state,
- complete audit snapshot is sealed.

Purpose: preserve civilisation-scale safety.

---

## 34.5 Emergency Override Doctrine

Emergency override is **authority-first, justification-immediate**.

It is lawful only when:
- time does not permit committee review,
- harm risk is non-theoretical,
- custody integrity is threatened.

Every emergency override must record:
- trigger cause,
- enforcement level,
- duration limit,
- restoration criteria.

No emergency action is valid without receipts.

---

## 34.6 Reinstatement & Restoration

Authority is restored only when:

1. The original trigger is resolved.
2. Receipt continuity is verified.
3. The Mandate Custodian™ approves restoration.
4. The restoration is logged as a distinct governance event.

Restoration without proof is prohibited.

---

## 34.7 Evidence & Receipt Spine

Every MER™ event generates a minimum evidentiary chain:

- trigger record,
- mandate state snapshot,
- enforcement action log,
- restoration record (if applicable).

These are bound under Discovery Receipt Standard™ (DRS™)
to ensure auditability and court admissibility.

---

## 34.8 Relationship to HML™, OPS™, ASA™, and DRS™

- **OPS™** determines when enforcement is required.
- **HML™** authorises and owns intervention.
- **ASA™** may perform constrained validation.
- **DRS™** preserves evidentiary truth.

MER™ is the execution bridge between doctrine and reality.

---

## 34.9 Canonical Statement

TruthSeal™ does not grant unconditional power.

It grants **revocable authority under law**.

A system may grow more capable.
But enforcement remains:
human,
provable,
and immediate.

## Chapter 34 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

Authority is not a reward.
It is a contract with teeth.

MER™ exists so that
no intelligence,
no matter how advanced,
can escape lawful human restraint.
