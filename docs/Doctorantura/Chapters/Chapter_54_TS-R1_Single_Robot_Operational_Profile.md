**PREAMBLE — SCOPE & NON-STATUTORY NOTICE**

This chapter is a Doctorantura explanatory chapter.

It is NOT statutory law.

All binding authority governing single-robot deployment, autonomy, and operational limits resides exclusively in the statutory file:

docs/doctorantura/robotics/R1_Single_Robot_Profile_v1.0.md

This chapter exists solely to explain, contextualise, and academically ground TS-R1 within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI.

No provision in this chapter may override, reinterpret, or dilute statutory robotics law.

────────────────────────────────────────

**1. POSITION OF TS-R1 IN THE ROBOTICS HIERARCHY**

TS-R1 — Single Robot Operational Profile defines the maximum lawful autonomy and operational scope for any individually deployed robotic system under TruthSeal™ governance.

TS-R1 is:

• Subordinate to TS-R — Global Robotics Law  
• Superior to any implementation, firmware, policy, or behavioural layer  
• Foundational to all collective profiles (TS-R2, TS-R3)

Every robotic unit begins governance evaluation at the TS-R1 level.

No system may bypass TS-R1 by virtue of scale, networking, intelligence, or task classification.

────────────────────────────────────────

**2. WHY SINGLE-ROBOT LAW IS FOUNDATIONAL**

TS-R1 establishes the irreducible ethical and legal unit of robotics governance: the individual agent.

This reflects a core TruthSeal™ principle:

Ethical irreversibility begins at the smallest actionable unit.

If a single robot may not lawfully perform an action, no collective system composed of such robots may lawfully perform it either.

This prevents:

• Moral laundering via swarms
• Distributed responsibility dilution
• Emergent behaviour loopholes
• Post-hoc justification through aggregation

TS-R1 therefore anchors LEI = 1 at the individual actuation level.

────────────────────────────────────────

**3. OPERATIONAL CONCEPT OF “SINGLE ROBOT”**

Within TruthSeal™, a “single robot” is defined as:

• One autonomous or semi-autonomous agent
• With its own actuation capability
• Capable of irreversible interaction with the physical or informational world
• Regardless of whether it is later networked, supervised, or coordinated

A robot does NOT cease to be governed by TS-R1 merely because it joins a fleet or swarm.

TS-R1 constraints persist and propagate upward.

────────────────────────────────────────

**4. TS-R1 AND AUTONOMY LIMITS**

TS-R1 defines:

• Maximum lawful autonomy
• Permissible decision scopes
• Prohibited actions
• Mandatory human override domains
• Safety, ethical, and coherence constraints

These limits are absolute at the unit level.

They are not recommendations.
They are not defaults.
They are enforceable ceilings.

Any attempt to exceed them constitutes a statutory violation under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

────────────────────────────────────────

**5. RELATIONSHIP TO TS-R2 AND TS-R3**

TS-R1 is inherited by:

• TS-R2 (Fleet & Swarm Robotics)
• TS-R3 (Swarm Autonomy Ceiling)

Key rule:

No collective system may perform an action prohibited to an individual unit.

TS-R2 may only add stricter coordination constraints.
TS-R3 may only impose stricter autonomy ceilings.

Neither may relax TS-R1.

This ensures monotonic tightening of control, never loosening.

────────────────────────────────────────

**6. ENFORCEMENT PHILOSOPHY**

TS-R1 embodies the TruthSeal™ enforcement axiom:

Responsibility cannot be averaged.

Each robotic act is evaluated as if it stood alone.

Collective context may increase restriction — never reduce it.

This design eliminates ambiguity in accountability, audit, and post-incident adjudication.

────────────────────────────────────────

**7. SUMMARY**

TS-R1 is the ethical bedrock of the TruthSeal™ Robotics Statutory Regime.

It ensures that:

• Every robotic action is legally attributable
• Every act is ethically bounded
• Every escalation remains irreversible under LEI = 1

Without TS-R1, no higher-order robotics governance is coherent.

With TS-R1, the entire hierarchy becomes enforceable, auditable, and sovereign.
