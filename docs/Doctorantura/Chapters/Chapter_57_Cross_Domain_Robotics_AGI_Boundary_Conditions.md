## PREAMBLE — SCOPE & NON-STATUTORY NOTICE

This chapter is a **Doctorantura explanatory chapter**.

It is **NOT statutory law**.

All binding authority governing:
- Robotics systems  
- AGI systems  
- Cross-domain interaction  
- Autonomy ceilings  
- Escalation thresholds  

resides exclusively in the statutory instruments of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc, including but not limited to:

- TS-R — Global Robotics Law  
- TS-R1 / TS-R2 / TS-R3  
- AGI Sovereign Arc statutes and ceilings  

This chapter exists solely to **explain boundary conditions** between domains.

---

## I. THE NECESSITY OF DOMAIN SEPARATION

TruthSeal™ treats **Robotics** and **AGI** as distinct legal domains.

They may interact.  
They may coordinate.  
They may exchange signals.

They may **never collapse into a single authority surface**.

Failure to separate domains produces:
- Jurisdictional ambiguity  
- Autonomy leakage  
- Responsibility dilution  
- Irreversible governance failure  

This chapter defines *why separation exists* and *how it is enforced*.

---

## II. DEFINING THE DOMAINS

### Robotics Domain
Governed by TS-R statutes.

Characteristics:
- Physical embodiment
- Actuation in the material world
- Energy, motion, force, presence
- Immediate harm potential

Robotics law is **actuation-first**.

---

### AGI Domain
Governed by the Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework.

Characteristics:
- Cognitive agency
- Planning, reasoning, abstraction
- Non-physical action capacity
- Indirect harm amplification

AGI law is **decision-first**.

---

## III. THE HARD BOUNDARY PRINCIPLE

No system may simultaneously operate as:
- A statutory robotic agent **and**
- A sovereign AGI authority

At runtime, a system is **one or the other**.

Hybrid systems must:
- Declare active domain
- Obey the stricter applicable ceiling
- Yield authority across a one-way boundary

There is no dual-sovereignty state.

---

## IV. AUTHORITY TRANSFER RULE

When an AGI system issues guidance to robotics:

- Robotics law **always prevails**
- TS-R ceilings override AGI intent
- Physical execution remains bound to TS-R1/2/3

When robotics telemetry feeds AGI reasoning:

- AGI may analyse
- AGI may recommend
- AGI may not directly actuate

The boundary is **advisory inward**, **binding outward**.

---

## V. AUTONOMY ESCALATION CONTAINMENT

Robotic swarms approaching autonomy thresholds (TS-R3):

- Must not delegate escalation decisions to AGI
- Must halt or degrade autonomously
- Must require human mandate for boundary crossing

AGI systems may **never**:
- Override TS-R3 ceilings
- Authorise irreversible physical action
- Bypass swarm autonomy limits

---

## VI. RESPONSIBILITY NON-DELEGATION CLAUSE

Responsibility cannot cross domains.

- Robotics outcomes remain robotics responsibility
- AGI recommendations remain AGI responsibility
- No system may externalise fault across the boundary

This preserves **auditability**, **liability clarity**, and **ethical irreversibility**.

---

## VII. WHY THIS CHAPTER EXISTS

Without explicit boundary doctrine:
- Robotics law gets “intelligent exceptions”
- AGI law gains physical reach
- Responsibility becomes probabilistic

TruthSeal™ forbids probabilistic responsibility.

This chapter ensures:
- Law precedes intelligence
- Governance precedes optimisation
- Boundaries precede capability

---

## VIII. FINAL NON-DEROGATION CLAUSE

Nothing in this chapter may be used to:
- Authorise cross-domain actuation
- Collapse AGI and robotics governance
- Create hybrid sovereignty
- Override statutory ceilings

All binding authority remains in statutory law.
