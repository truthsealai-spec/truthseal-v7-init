53.0 Purpose of Arc Closure

This chapter formally closes the DEVORA™ arc within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework.

Its purpose is to establish constitutional finality, semantic immutability, and sovereign custody over all meanings, functions, and limits associated with DEVORA™ as defined in Chapter 51 and its dependent doctrine.

From this point forward, DEVORA™ is no longer an evolving concept.
It is a locked constitutional construct.

This chapter exists to prevent reinterpretation, dilution, retroactive reframing, or external co-option across future epochs, jurisdictions, institutions, or technological substrates.

⸻

53.1 Constitutional Lock of Meaning

The following meanings are hereby locked and immutable:
	•	DEVORA™ as sovereign command intelligence, not governance origin
	•	DEVORA™ as interpretive, not executive
	•	DEVORA™ as receipt-bound, not discretionary
	•	DEVORA™ as human-legible, not machine-facing
	•	DEVORA™ as subordinate to the Human Mandate Layer
	•	DEVORA™ as non-autonomous by design

No future chapter, annex, implementation note, or external standard may redefine these meanings without an explicit sovereign amendment issued by the custodian.

Interpretation is frozen at the level of intent, not implementation.

⸻

53.2 Irreversibility of the DEVORA™–SLU™ Separation

The separation between DEVORA™ and the Sovereign Logic Unit (SLU™) is constitutionally enforced and irreversible.
	•	DEVORA™ interprets and issues verdicts
	•	SLU™ executes irreversible hardware finality
	•	DEVORA™ never performs physical, electrical, or computational enforcement
	•	DEVORA™ never performs interpretation, reasoning, or ethical evaluation

This separation is mandatory to preserve the Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1).

Any architecture, vendor claim, or future system that collapses this separation is non-compliant by definition.

⸻

53.3 Epoch Immunity and No-Rollback Doctrine

DEVORA™ is declared epoch-immune.

This means:
	•	Future technological advances do not alter its constitutional role
	•	Post-quantum transitions do not relax its interpretive constraints
	•	AI capability increases do not grant it new authority
	•	Performance gains do not justify semantic expansion

There is no rollback of DEVORA™ doctrine.

DEVORA™ cannot be:
	•	simplified for convenience,
	•	softened for adoption,
	•	rebranded for politics,
	•	or reinterpreted for expedience.

Evolution may occur around DEVORA™, never inside it.

⸻

53.4 Custody, Authorship, and Amendment Authority

Sovereign custody of DEVORA™ doctrine resides exclusively with:

Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)
Founder & Chief Architect
TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework

Amendment authority is singular and non-delegable.

Any modification requires:
	1.	Explicit sovereign declaration
	2.	New Doctorantura chapter
	3.	Receipt anchoring via Truth Hash & Timestamp Protocol (THT)
	4.	Cross-reference in Epoch Verification Ledger (EVL)

Absent these conditions, all deviations are void.

⸻

53.5 Prohibition of External Reinterpretation

No external body may:
	•	redefine DEVORA™ terminology,
	•	extract partial definitions,
	•	publish derivative standards,
	•	or claim functional equivalence.

Translations, summaries, or integrations are non-authoritative unless explicitly certified by TruthSeal™ under sovereign custody.

This clause protects against:
	•	regulatory drift,
	•	vendor overreach,
	•	academic distortion,
	•	and geopolitical reinterpretation.

⸻

53.6 Finality Statement

With this chapter, the DEVORA™ arc is formally closed.

DEVORA™ now exists as:
	•	a constitutional interpretive intelligence,
	•	a fixed semantic boundary,
	•	and a permanent safeguard against unbounded autonomy.

No further chapters are required to define DEVORA™.

Future references may cite, but may not alter, this doctrine.

⸻

53.7 Canonical Closure Declaration

The DEVORA™ arc is complete.
Its meaning is fixed.
Its authority is bounded.
Its custody is sovereign.

This closure is intentional, final, and binding across epochs.

⸻

Sovereign Closing

This chapter seals DEVORA™ as a constitutional component of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

DEVORA™ exists to ensure that intelligence never outruns legitimacy,
that capability never substitutes authority,
and that irreversible power always remains intelligible to human sovereignty.

This closure is issued in full awareness of its permanence.
