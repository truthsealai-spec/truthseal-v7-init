# Chapter 53 — DEVORA™ Constitutional Sealing and Doctrinal Finality

version: 1.0  
status: FINAL — DOCTRINAL SEAL  
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
custody: Sovereign

## 53.0 Purpose of Constitutional Sealing

This chapter establishes the constitutional sealing of DEVORA™ as a **non-evolving doctrinal component** within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

It **does not** close the Sovereign Arc.

It **does not** define arc completion.

It **freezes the meaning, limits, authority boundaries, and interpretive role of DEVORA™** as already defined in Chapter 51 and constrained by Chapter 52.

DEVORA™ is sealed to prevent semantic drift, institutional reinterpretation, vendor distortion, or post-hoc doctrinal mutation across future epochs.

---

## 53.1 Constitutional Lock of Meaning

The following meanings are hereby locked and immutable:

- DEVORA™ as **sovereign command intelligence**, not governance origin  
- DEVORA™ as **interpretive**, not executive  
- DEVORA™ as **receipt-bound**, not discretionary  
- DEVORA™ as **human-legible**, not machine-facing  
- DEVORA™ as **constitutionally subordinate** to the Human Mandate Layer  
- DEVORA™ as **non-autonomous by design**

No future chapter, annex, implementation note, standard, or derivative work may redefine these meanings without an explicit sovereign amendment.

Interpretation is frozen at the level of **intent**, not implementation detail.

---

## 53.2 Irreversibility of the DEVORA™–SLU™ Separation

The separation between DEVORA™ and the Sovereign Logic Unit (SLU™) is constitutionally enforced and irreversible.

- DEVORA™ interprets and issues receipt-bound verdicts  
- SLU™ executes irreversible hardware finality  
- DEVORA™ never performs physical, electrical, or computational enforcement  
- SLU™ never performs interpretation, reasoning, or ethical evaluation  

Any architecture or claim that collapses this separation is **non-compliant by definition**.

---

## 53.3 Epoch Immunity and No-Rollback Doctrine

DEVORA™ is declared **epoch-immune**.

This means:

- Future technological advances do not alter its constitutional role  
- Post-quantum transitions do not relax interpretive constraints  
- Intelligence scale does not grant DEVORA™ new authority  
- Performance gains do not justify semantic expansion  

Evolution may occur **around** DEVORA™, never **inside** it.

---

## 53.4 Custody, Authorship, and Amendment Authority

Sovereign custody of DEVORA™ doctrine resides exclusively with:

**Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)**  
Founder & Chief Architect  
TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework

Amendment authority is **singular and non-delegable**.

Any modification requires:

1. Explicit sovereign declaration  
2. A new Doctorantura chapter  
3. Receipt anchoring via the Truth Hash & Timestamp Protocol (THT)  
4. Cross-reference in the Epoch Verification Ledger (EVL)

Absent these conditions, deviations are void.

---

## 53.5 Prohibition of External Reinterpretation

No external body may:

- redefine DEVORA™ terminology  
- extract partial definitions  
- publish derivative standards  
- claim functional equivalence  

Translations or summaries are non-authoritative unless explicitly certified under sovereign custody.

---

## 53.6 Doctrinal Finality Statement

This chapter seals DEVORA™ as a **constitutionally fixed interpretive component**.

DEVORA™ now exists as:

- a permanent semantic boundary  
- a non-expanding authority surface  
- a safeguard against unbounded autonomy  

No future chapter may weaken this seal.

---

## 53.7 Canonical Sealing Declaration

DEVORA™ meaning is fixed.  
DEVORA™ authority is bounded.  
DEVORA™ custody is sovereign.

This seal is intentional, final, and binding across epochs.
