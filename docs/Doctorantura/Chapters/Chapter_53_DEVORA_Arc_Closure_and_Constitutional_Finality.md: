53.0 Purpose of Constitutional Sealing

This chapter establishes the constitutional sealing of DEVORA™ as a fixed interpretive component within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework.

Its purpose is to freeze the meaning, limits, authority boundaries, and non-authoritative nature of DEVORA™ against reinterpretation, dilution, or functional expansion across future epochs, implementations, or jurisdictions.

This chapter does not close the Sovereign Arc.

It seals DEVORA™ as a non-evolving doctrinal component whose role, scope, and constraints are permanently fixed relative to the Sovereign Arc as a whole.

⸻

53.1 Constitutional Lock of Meaning

The following meanings are hereby locked and immutable:

• DEVORA™ as sovereign command intelligence, not governance origin  
• DEVORA™ as interpretive, not executive  
• DEVORA™ as receipt-bound, not discretionary  
• DEVORA™ as human-legible, not machine-facing  
• DEVORA™ as constitutionally subordinate to the Human Mandate Layer  
• DEVORA™ as non-autonomous by design  

No future chapter, annex, implementation note, vendor claim, or external standard may redefine these meanings without an explicit sovereign amendment issued by the custodian.

Interpretation is frozen at the level of intent, not implementation.

⸻

53.2 Irreversibility of the DEVORA™–SLU™ Separation

The separation between DEVORA™ and the Sovereign Logic Unit (SLU™) is constitutionally enforced and irreversible.

• DEVORA™ interprets and issues verdicts  
• SLU™ executes irreversible hardware finality  
• DEVORA™ never performs physical, electrical, or computational enforcement  
• DEVORA™ never performs ethical adjudication or mandate creation  
• SLU™ never performs interpretation or reasoning  

Any architecture, system, or claim that collapses this separation is non-compliant by definition.

This separation preserves the Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1).

⸻

53.3 Epoch Immunity and No-Rollback Doctrine

DEVORA™ is declared epoch-immune in meaning and authority.

This means:

• Technological advances do not alter its constitutional role  
• Post-quantum transitions do not relax its constraints  
• Increased intelligence capability does not grant DEVORA™ new authority  
• Performance gains do not justify semantic expansion  

There is no rollback of DEVORA™ doctrine.

Evolution may occur around DEVORA™, never inside it.

⸻

53.4 Custody, Authorship, and Amendment Authority

Sovereign custody of DEVORA™ doctrine resides exclusively with:

Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
Founder & Chief Architect  
TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework  

Amendment authority is singular and non-delegable.

Any modification requires:

1. Explicit sovereign declaration  
2. A new Doctorantura chapter  
3. Receipt anchoring via the Truth Hash & Timestamp Protocol (THT)  
4. Cross-reference in the Epoch Verification Ledger (EVL)  

Absent these conditions, all deviations are void.

⸻

53.5 Prohibition of External Reinterpretation

No external body may:

• redefine DEVORA™ terminology  
• extract partial definitions  
• publish derivative standards  
• claim functional equivalence  
• imply delegated authority  

Translations, summaries, or integrations are non-authoritative unless explicitly certified under sovereign custody.

This clause protects against regulatory drift, vendor overreach, academic distortion, and geopolitical reinterpretation.

⸻

53.6 Doctrinal Finality Statement

With this chapter, the definition, scope, and constitutional role of DEVORA™ are sealed.

DEVORA™ now exists as:

• a fixed interpretive intelligence component  
• a bounded constitutional surface  
• a permanent safeguard against semantic drift  

No future chapter may alter DEVORA™ meaning without explicit sovereign amendment.

⸻

53.7 Canonical Closure Declaration

DEVORA™ is fixed in meaning.  
DEVORA™ is bounded in authority.  
DEVORA™ is sealed against reinterpretation.

The Sovereign Arc remains the unified totality of the framework.

⸻

Sovereign Closing

This chapter seals DEVORA™ as a constitutional component of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

DEVORA™ exists to ensure that intelligence never outruns legitimacy,
that capability never substitutes authority,
and that irreversible power always remains intelligible to human sovereignty.
