53.0 PURPOSE OF CONSTITUTIONAL SEALING

This chapter establishes the constitutional sealing of DEVORA™ as a defined doctrinal component within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc. Its purpose is to permanently fix meaning, authority boundaries, and interpretive scope already articulated in prior chapters, without asserting closure of the Sovereign Arc itself. The Sovereign Arc remains the total constitutional structure formed by all chapters collectively, not by any single doctrinal seal.

The function of this chapter is preventative rather than operational. It exists to eliminate semantic drift, retroactive reinterpretation, scope inflation, and authority creep that may arise through political pressure, institutional convenience, or technical overreach. DEVORA™ remains operationally relevant where lawfully integrated, but its constitutional intent is rendered non-evolving.

This sealing operates strictly at the doctrinal layer. It does not inhibit lawful research, compliant engineering, or certified deployment. Instead, it ensures that all such activity remains bounded by immutable intent rather than mutable interpretation. The sealing applies across jurisdictions, institutions, and epochs, preserving legitimacy without obstructing lawful progress.

53.1 CONSTITUTIONAL FIXATION OF MEANING

All meanings attributed to DEVORA™ in preceding doctrine are hereby constitutionally fixed. Interpretation is bound to recorded sovereign intent and canonical articulation, not to future paraphrase, commentary, or contextual reframing. Meaning may be explained for clarity, but it may not be expanded, reduced, or reinterpreted to serve convenience or expedience.

This fixation applies uniformly across legal, technical, diplomatic, regulatory, and academic contexts. No environment is exempt from the binding nature of this definition, and no medium grants license for reinterpretation. Meaning remains independent of software implementation, hardware substrate, organisational structure, or deployment model.

Paraphrase does not confer authority. Explanation does not grant modification. Translation does not permit reinterpretation. This fixation preserves legitimacy by ensuring that DEVORA™ remains intelligible, bounded, and consistent regardless of future technological or institutional change.

53.2 IRREVERSIBILITY OF FUNCTIONAL SEPARATION

DEVORA™ is constitutionally confined to interpretive intelligence and human-legible verdict articulation. It does not execute actions, perform physical intervention, isolate hardware, initiate shutdown, or enact irreversible change under any circumstance. Irreversible enforcement remains categorically external to DEVORA™ and is never co-located with interpretive reasoning.

This separation is mandatory and non-negotiable. No lawful architecture may merge interpretive judgment with irreversible execution, regardless of performance benefits, latency reduction, or operational convenience. Any such collapse constitutes a violation of the Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1).

The separation persists across classical, hybrid, and post-quantum computational paradigms. Increased capability does not justify recombination. Efficiency does not override ethics. This boundary ensures that no system ever possesses both moral judgment and irreversible power within the same authority locus.

53.3 EPOCH STABILITY AND NON-ROLLBACK

DEVORA™ doctrine is declared epoch-stable. Advances in artificial intelligence capability, reasoning depth, autonomy, or computational scale do not alter its constitutional role. There is no rollback, softening, or reinterpretation under future technological, political, or geopolitical conditions.

Post-quantum transition does not relax interpretive constraints. Institutional reform does not grant new authority. Market adoption does not justify semantic expansion. DEVORA™ remains bound to its original intent regardless of external pressure or internal capability growth.

Evolution may occur around the doctrine through compliant systems and certified architectures. Evolution may not occur within the doctrine itself. This ensures that legitimacy remains stable even as capability accelerates.

---

53.4 CUSTODY AND AMENDMENT AUTHORITY

Sovereign custody of DEVORA™ doctrine resides exclusively with the constitutional custodian of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc. Amendment authority is singular, explicit, and non-delegable. No committee, regulator, vendor, academic body, or successor institution may alter doctrine through implication, reinterpretation, or derivative framing.

Any amendment requires an explicit sovereign declaration, issuance of a new Doctorantura chapter, cryptographic receipt anchoring, and formal linkage within the Epoch Verification Ledger. Absent these conditions, any modification attempt is void from inception.

Custody survives institutional restructuring, political turnover, jurisdictional change, and organisational dissolution. Doctrine does not transfer by inheritance or convenience.

---

53.5 PROHIBITION OF EXTERNAL REINTERPRETATION

No external body may redefine DEVORA™ terminology, extract partial doctrine, publish derivative standards, or claim functional equivalence. Translations, summaries, integrations, or references are non-authoritative unless explicitly certified under sovereign custody.

This prohibition exists to prevent regulatory drift, vendor overreach, academic distortion, and geopolitical reinterpretation. It protects meaning and authority boundaries rather than branding or market identity.

Violation of this clause constitutes a custody breach under TruthSeal™ governance and invalidates any claimed authority derived therefrom.

53.6 DOCTRINAL FINALITY STATEMENT

With this chapter, DEVORA™ is sealed as a non-evolving doctrinal component within the TruthSeal™ framework. Finality applies strictly to meaning, authority limits, and interpretive role. It does not restrict lawful research, compliant engineering, or certified deployment within established boundaries.

Future chapters may reference DEVORA™ where necessary, but may not expand, dilute, or redefine its constitutional position. Doctrinal finality ensures legitimacy without freezing lawful innovation elsewhere.

---

53.7 CANONICAL SEALING DECLARATION

DEVORA™ is constitutionally sealed to ensure that intelligence never outruns legitimacy, capability never substitutes authority, and irreversible power remains intelligible to human sovereignty.

This sealing is intentional, precise, and binding across jurisdictions and epochs. It is issued in full awareness of its permanence and legal consequence.
