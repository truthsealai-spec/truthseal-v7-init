## 13.1 Purpose and Outcome

This chapter defines the **Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™)** as the constitutional custody and authority system governing all TruthSeal™ deployments.

It establishes, at committee-operational level:

• who may **own**, **command**, **supervise**, **override**, and **audit** governed intelligence  
• how authority is **validated**, **constrained**, and **revoked**  
• how liability and accountability remain **human-anchored** across TS-A1™, NeuroVest™, TS-R1™, and TS-R2™

This chapter focuses exclusively on **human authority, legal custody, and command legitimacy**.

---

## 13.2 Why the Human Mandate Layer Exists

Advanced intelligence and robotics cannot be sovereign unless responsibility remains assignable.

Without HML™:
• mandate becomes ambiguous  
• liability becomes disputable  
• authority drifts from institutions to machines  

HML™ prevents that drift by ensuring **every material instruction is bound to a named, authenticated human or institution**.

---

## 13.3 Doctrine Boundary

This chapter defines **committee-level HML™ doctrine**.

It specifies:
• authority roles  
• identity requirements  
• command acceptance logic  
• override legitimacy  
• audit visibility  

It does not disclose:
• Ω enforcement internals  
• classified control mathematics  
• deployment thresholds reserved for Doctorantura

---

## 13.4 Position in the TruthSeal™ Stack

HML™ sits above all operational layers:

• TS-A1 AEGIS™ — governs execution admission and lawful computation  
• NeuroVest™ — governs behavioural discipline and memory  
• TS-R1™ — governs single-agent physical sovereignty  
• TS-R2™ — governs swarm / fleet sovereignty  
• TCS™, ACS™, CHS™ — provide coherence, aim, and operational health signals  

HML™ defines **who is allowed to instruct, override, and answer** for every layer.

No TruthSeal™ deployment is complete without an explicit HML™.

---

## 13.5 Authority Roles (Canonical Map)

HML™ recognises four non-interchangeable roles:

### 1) Owner / Sovereign Principal
• ultimate legal authority and liability holder  
• defines mandate scope and policy envelope  
• appoints or revokes Guardians and Operators  

### 2) Guardian
• responsible for safety posture and configuration integrity  
• manages CHS™ policy enforcement  
• may initiate safe-stop or shutdown  

### 3) Operator
• executes task-level commands within authorised scope  
• cannot exceed CHS™ limits  
• must refuse unsafe or unauthorised actions  

### 4) Auditor / Regulator
• legally entitled to inspect receipts and EVL™ records  
• may require remediation under applicable law  

Every action must be traceable to one or more of these roles.

---

## 13.6 Identity and Authentication Requirements

Each role must be bound to:
• a verified person or institution  
• authenticated credentials (keys, hardware token, or equivalent)  
• jurisdiction and legal contact metadata  

**Anonymous authority is forbidden.**

If identity assurance fails, the command is rejected and a receipt is generated.

---

## 13.7 Rights and Permissions by Role

• **Owner**
  - define policy envelopes  
  - set CHS™ ceilings  
  - approve or revoke deployments  

• **Guardian**
  - adjust parameters within Owner boundaries  
  - request CHS™ band changes  
  - trigger safe-stop  

• **Operator**
  - issue commands within CHS™ limits  
  - initiate emergency safe-stop  

• **Auditor / Regulator**
  - access lawful evidence  
  - require explanations or corrective plans  

All rights are conditional and revocable.

---

## 13.8 Duties and Liability Anchoring

HML™ binds authority to responsibility:

• **Owner** — ultimate civil and criminal liability  
• **Guardian** — safety posture and CHS™ correctness  
• **Operator** — compliant execution and anomaly reporting  
• **Auditor** — lawful use of forensic access  

TruthSeal™ makes these duties **ledger-visible**.

---

## 13.9 CHS™ Authority Binding (Explicit)

Authority scales strictly with CHS™ band:

• **CHS/L (Low)**  
  - system restricted or safe-stopped  
  - only Owner or Guardian may authorise recovery  

• **CHS/M (Medium)**  
  - Operators act within constrained playbooks  
  - elevated-risk actions require Guardian approval  

• **CHS/H (High)**  
  - routine operational authority permitted  
  - public, financial, medical, or high-energy actions remain gated  

• **CHS/UH (Ultra-High)**  
  - expanded autonomy only with proven stability and ledger history  
  - HML™ retains absolute revocation power  

Robotic and hardware layers must enforce this **physically**, not procedurally.

---

## 13.10 Command Acceptance Logic

Every command is evaluated as follows:

1) Verify issuer identity and role  
2) Verify CHS™ eligibility  
3) Verify contextual legality  
4) Verify compliance with TruthSeal™ laws  

Failure at any step results in rejection or degradation with a receipt stating:
• issuer role  
• rejection reason  
• CHS™ band  
• timestamp and mandate reference  

---

## 13.11 Override and Emergency Powers

HML™ defines three override classes:

• **Soft Override** — CHS™ down-band or behaviour suspension  
• **Hard Override** — immediate safe-stop and isolation  
• **Regulatory Override** — lawful external mandate  

All overrides are binding and receipted.

---

## 13.12 Receipts and Legal Interface

All significant human–system interactions emit receipts containing:
• role identity  
• command or override  
• outcome  
• CHS™ state before and after  

These records are written to EVL™ and may be consolidated into QENC™ ProofCapsules.

---

## 13.13 Canonical Statement

**The Human Mandate Layer™ is the TruthSeal™ construct that fixes sovereignty in human and institutional hands.**

Without HML™, authority drifts.  
With HML™, responsibility is permanent, visible, and enforceable.
