## Chapter 42 —
## Scoring Primitives for the Metamodule Engine™
## STS™ · SCS™ · MCS™ (Non-Compensatory Triad)

version: 1.0  
status: FINAL DRAFT — Doctorantura Edition  
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
custody: Internal — Canon upon Founder Approval  

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 42.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines the **scoring primitives** that quantify integrity, coherence, and governability of TruthSeal™ metamodule snapshots.

These primitives are not analytics.
They are **governance instruments**.

They exist to ensure that:
- integrity is measurable,
- weakness cannot be masked by aggregation,
- and governance decisions are anchored to receipts, not narrative.

The scoring triad defined herein operates on **B-VSS™ (Bounded, Versioned System State)** snapshots and produces **non-compensatory, court-defensible signals** for enforcement, escalation, and rollback.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 42.1 The Non-Compensatory Triad

TruthSeal™ defines three primary scoring primitives:

- **STS™ — Source Trust Score™**
- **SCS™ — System Coherence Score™**
- **MCS™ — Metamodule Coherence Score™**

Together, they form a **non-compensatory integrity triad**.

No composite score may override a critical weakness.
No aesthetic confidence may outweigh a single failed gate.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 42.2 Position in the Sovereign Stack

The scoring primitives operate inside the **Metamodule Governance Loop** and interface with:

- **HML™** — Human Mandate Layer™ (authority & override legitimacy)
- **TGF™** — Third Guardian Firewall™ (veto, quarantine, safe-stop)
- **EVL™** — Epoch Verification Ledger™ (state continuity)
- **THT Protocol™** — Truth Hash & Timestamp discipline (sealing & anchoring)

They are explicitly compatible with, but do not redefine:

- **TCS™** — Traykov Coherence Score™ (court-grade coherence)
- **ACS™** — Aim Coherence Score™ (trajectory alignment)
- **CHS™** — Coherence Health Score™ (operational maturity bands)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 42.3 STS™ — Source Trust Score™

**STS™** evaluates whether an input source is **eligible for sovereign processing**.

It operates strictly at the **ingestion boundary**.

Minimum evaluated dimensions:

- **Source Integrity** — canonical origin trust and audit history
- **Temporal Integrity** — relevance to the active EVL epoch
- **Signature Integrity** — cryptographic authenticity and non-repudiation
- **Corpus Correlation** — consistency against ledger-aligned baselines
- **Metadata Integrity** — completeness and schema compliance

**Sovereign rule:**  
STS™ may inform confidence, but **cannot override** a failed minimum gate on any critical factor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 42.4 SCS™ — System Coherence Score™

**SCS™** evaluates whether the **active system state** remains coherent with its mandated governance posture.

It answers one question only:
> Is the system behaving as authorised?

Minimum evaluated dimensions:

- **Policy Compliance** — adherence to active HML™ mandates
- **Environmental Congruence** — alignment with required security posture
- **Control Integrity** — execution and auditability of controls
- **Sequencing Integrity** — chronological validity within EVL™

Naming discipline:
SCS™ is intentionally distinct from **ACS™** to prevent semantic collision.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 42.5 MCS™ — Metamodule Coherence Score™

**MCS™** is a composite **reporting indicator**, not an authority override.

Purpose:
- provide readable oversight summaries,
- support trend analysis across epochs,
- feed executive and regulatory dashboards.

**Non-authoritative rule:**  
MCS™ is always subordinate to **minimum-gate enforcement** in STS™ and SCS™.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 42.6 The Minimum-Gate Law (Non-Compensation)

TruthSeal™ enforces **non-compensatory integrity**.

Definitions:
- **T_min** — minimum allowable threshold for any critical factor
- **Iᵢ** — individual integrity factors within STS™ or SCS™

**Operational law:**  
If any critical **Iᵢ < T_min**, the metamodule declares an **integrity breach** regardless of MCS™ magnitude.

This rule is absolute.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 42.7 Consequence Tier (CT) Assignment

Consequences are assigned independently of maturity or health optics.

- **CT-1** — calibration-level remediation
- **CT-2** — soft correction
- **CT-3** — hard correction with mandatory human review
- **CT-4** — quarantine / safe-stop mandate

CT derives from **minimum-gate severity**, not from CHS™.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 42.8 Interaction with CHS™ and Core Metrics

**CHS™** remains the operational health banding system:
- CHS/L, CHS/M, CHS/H, CHS/UH

Rules:
- CT-4 triggers **TGF™ veto** immediately
- CHS may be down-banded after CT breach
- **TCS™** and **ACS™** remain authoritative in their own domains

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 42.9 Receipts and Ledger Binding

Every scoring event emits receipt-bound evidence under **THT** and **EVL** continuity.

Each snapshot must reference:
- B-VSS™ identifier
- STS™ component values
- SCS™ component values
- MCS™ composite
- CT assignment (if any)
- CHS impact (if any)
- HML™ authority context

No score exists without provenance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 42.10 Canonical Statement

The scoring primitives of TruthSeal™ — **STS™, SCS™, and MCS™** —
define measurable integrity and system-state coherence.

They are non-compensatory.
They are receipt-bound.
They are ledger-continuous.

No system may claim sovereign integrity
unless it can prove it
at the level of its weakest critical link.
