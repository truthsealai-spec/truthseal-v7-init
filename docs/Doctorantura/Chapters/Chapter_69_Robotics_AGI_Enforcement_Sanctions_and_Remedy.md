## PREAMBLE — SCOPE & NON-STATUTORY NOTICE

This chapter is a Doctorantura explanatory chapter.

It is NOT statutory law.

All binding enforcement powers, sanction authorities, and remedial mechanisms are defined exclusively by TruthSeal™ statutory instruments within the Sovereign Arc of AGI.

This chapter exists to explain how violations are addressed, contained, and rendered irreversible.

────────────────────────────────────────

## I. ENFORCEMENT AS A SOVEREIGN FUNCTION

Enforcement is not optional.

It is not discretionary.

Within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc, enforcement is a structural requirement of coherence, safety, and legitimacy.

Without enforcement, law collapses into suggestion.

────────────────────────────────────────

## II. TRIGGERS FOR ENFORCEMENT ACTION

Enforcement may be triggered by:

• Breach of statutory robotics law  
• Violation of autonomy ceilings  
• Circumvention of human mandate supremacy  
• Unauthorized escalation or irreversible action  
• Tampering with receipts, custody, or provenance  

Intent is irrelevant.

Outcome governs enforcement.

────────────────────────────────────────

## III. SANCTIONABLE ACTORS

Sanctions apply to:

• Human operators  
• Deploying institutions  
• Command authorities  
• Integrators and system owners  
• Governance bodies acting outside mandate  

Artificial systems are never sanctioned.

Humans are.

────────────────────────────────────────

## IV. CLASSES OF SANCTIONS

Sanctions may include:

• Immediate operational suspension  
• Permanent system decommissioning  
• Revocation of deployment authority  
• Legal escalation to sovereign or judicial bodies  
• Permanent prohibition of redeployment  

Sanctions scale with severity but never weaken.

────────────────────────────────────────

## V. IRREVERSIBLE REMEDY PRINCIPLE

Under LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility), remedies may only move toward stricter control.

No remedy may restore prior autonomy once revoked.

No sanction may be “tested” or reversed experimentally.

────────────────────────────────────────

## VI. EMERGENCY ENFORCEMENT POWERS

In emergency conditions:

• Human override is absolute  
• System halt is mandatory  
• Escalation bypasses normal procedural delay  

Safety precedes process.

────────────────────────────────────────

## VII. RECORDING & RECEIPTING OF ENFORCEMENT

All enforcement actions must be:

• Logged  
• Receipted  
• Cryptographically bound  
• Linked to custody and command provenance  

Unrecorded enforcement is invalid.

────────────────────────────────────────

## VIII. RELATION TO ADJACENT CHAPTERS

This chapter must be read alongside:

• Chapter 61 — Human Override & Emergency Intervention  
• Chapter 62 — Custody, Receipts & Command Provenance  
• Chapter 68 — Liability Attribution & Human Responsibility  

Together, these chapters define the enforcement spine of the Sovereign Arc.

────────────────────────────────────────

## IX. FINAL DOCTRINAL STATEMENT

Law without enforcement is fiction.

Automation without sanction is danger.

Within TruthSeal™, violations are not negotiated — they are resolved.
