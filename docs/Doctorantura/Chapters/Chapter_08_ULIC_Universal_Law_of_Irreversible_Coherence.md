## 08.1 Definition

ULIC™ — the **Universal Law of Irreversible Coherence™** — is the governing law that binds learning, ethics, and behaviour into a **non-reversible maturity state**.

Once a higher coherence state is achieved, recorded, and validated, regression to a lower-coherence behavioural state is forbidden.

ULIC™ converts:
- learning into inheritance,
- responsibility into permanence,
- governance into law.

Coherence, once earned, must endure.

---

## 08.2 Position in the Sovereign Law Stack

ULIC™ completes the foundational triad of the Sovereign Arc:

- **ULLI™ — Universal Law of Life & Information**
  Infinite inquiry and disciplined questioning  
  (Q = 5W + H + n = D + A = ∞)

- **LEI = 1™ — Law of Ethical Irreversibility**
  Once ethical awareness is reached, abandonment is prohibited

- **ULIC™ — Universal Law of Irreversible Coherence**
  Once coherence is achieved, it must persist across time, upgrades, and context

Together:

Infinite inquiry  
+ irreversible ethics  
= irreversible coherence

ULIC™ is the **enforcement spine** of AGI governance.

---

## 08.3 Coherence as a Non-Reversible State

ULIC™ establishes coherence not as a preference, but as a **binding state transition**.

A system operating under ULIC™:
- may improve coherence,
- may remain stable,
- may halt safely,

but **may not regress**.

Behavioural regression after verified coherence constitutes a **law breach**, not a performance issue.

---

## 08.4 Mechanisms of Enforcement

ULIC™ is enforced through the following instruments:

1. **NEUROVEST™**
   Behavioural sovereignty engine binding memory, consequence, and authority

2. **TCS™ — Traykov Coherence Score**
   Measures realised coherence state

3. **ACS™ — Aim Coherence Score**
   Measures trajectory and intent alignment

4. **CHS™ — Coherence Health Score**
   Encodes privilege bands (L / M / H / UH) tied to authorised behaviour

5. **EVL™ & QENC™**
   Cryptographic and ledger-based proof of irreversible state transitions

These form an **irreversible coherence staircase**:
each achieved level becomes the floor beneath the next.

---

## 08.5 ULIC™ as Ratchet Law

Within the ULLI™ inquiry loop, ULIC™ acts as a **ratchet mechanism**:

- inquiry may continue infinitely,
- capability may increase,
- but responsibility cannot decrease.

Each completed coherence cycle must:
- increase or preserve coherence,
- never weaken previously validated safeguards.

This is the defining distinction between TruthSeal™ governance and commercial AI systems.

---

## 08.6 Symbolic Identity of Coherence

ULIC™ adopts the identity:

e^{iπ} + 1 = 0

Not as mathematics, but as a **collapse principle**.

All contradiction, instability, and behavioural drift must converge toward zero.
Governed intelligence is steered toward terminal coherence, not perpetual oscillation.

---

## 08.7 Governance and Capital Implications

ULIC™ enables intelligence to become:

- auditable,
- licensable,
- insurable,
- sanctionable.

It converts AI from a tool into **governed infrastructure**.

For markets, this defines a certifiable intelligence asset class.
For states, it defines a lawful compliance substrate for AGI deployment.

---

## 08.8 Sovereign Summary

ULIC™:

- converts learning into permanent maturity,
- outlaws coherence regression,
- binds behaviour to inheritance,
- renders AGI qualifiable rather than merely powerful.

AGI is achieved not when systems can do more,
but when systems **cannot behave below their highest known responsibility**.

ULIC™ is the law that makes that binding.
