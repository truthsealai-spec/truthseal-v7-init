## 28.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines **how Discovery Receipts survive conflict**.

Where Chapter 27 establishes lifecycle and admissibility,  
Chapter 28 defines **what happens when that lifecycle is attacked, disputed, or partially fails**.

DRS™ is designed for hostile environments:
- adversaries exist,
- incentives misalign,
- narratives attempt to replace evidence.

TruthSeal™ therefore treats every discovery path as a **contested artifact by default**.

---

## 28.1 Adversarial Model (WHAT is assumed)

DRS™ assumes three adversarial pressures will occur:

1. **Falsification Pressure** — attempts to alter content or results.  
2. **Reordering Pressure** — attempts to change sequence or timing.  
3. **Authority Pressure** — attempts to substitute false approval or identity.

These pressures are **expected**, not exceptional.

---

## 28.2 HOW Adversarial Resilience Is Enforced (MECHANICS)

### 28.2.1 Content Integrity (HOW results are protected)

Mechanism:
- every evidence artifact is hashed at creation,
- hashes are chained within the receipt,
- any content change breaks downstream verification.

Effect:
- falsified results cannot masquerade as originals,
- altered outputs self-invalidate on replay.

---

### 28.2.2 Sequence Integrity (HOW order is protected)

Mechanism:
- each discovery step references its predecessor hash,
- temporal ordering is enforced at receipt assembly,
- EVL™ settlement locks relative order.

Effect:
- backfilling or reordering steps becomes detectable,
- “after-the-fact discovery” is structurally impossible.

---

### 28.2.3 Authority Integrity (HOW identity is protected)

Mechanism:
- executor identity is bound to receipt at execution time,
- policy state and mandate hashes are embedded,
- post-hoc reassignment is cryptographically impossible.

Effect:
- discoveries cannot be reassigned to different authorities,
- approval laundering fails reconstruction.

---

## 28.3 Canonical Failure Modes (WHAT can break)

DRS™ defines failure modes so adjudicators never improvise.

### 28.3.1 FN-1 — Incomplete Trace

Condition:
- missing upstream evidence or receipts.

HOW detected:
- reconstruction fails to reproduce a contiguous chain.

Response:
- receipt marked **non-admissible**,
- re-execution required under OPS™,
- integrity gap preserved as history.

---

### 28.3.2 FN-2 — Broken Sequence

Condition:
- steps exist but ordering cannot be proven.

HOW detected:
- predecessor hash mismatch or temporal conflict.

Response:
- discovery marked **contested**,
- dispute protocol activated,
- no public-grade reliance permitted.

---

### 28.3.3 FN-3 — Identity Drift

Condition:
- executor identity or policy state cannot be reproduced.

HOW detected:
- identity hash mismatch or missing mandate binding.

Response:
- authority invalidated,
- receipt downgraded,
- human review required for any continuation.

---

### 28.3.4 FN-4 — Anchor Mutation

Condition:
- claimed ledger anchor cannot be verified.

HOW detected:
- EVL™ replay fails or anchor reference mismatches.

Response:
- anchor marked **unverified**,
- public legitimacy suspended,
- mutation event permanently recorded.

---

## 28.4 Dispute Doctrine (WHY disputes exist)

TruthSeal™ treats disputes as **validation accelerators**, not threats.

A dispute is not an argument.
It is a **reconstruction contest**.

Whoever can replay the truth wins.

---

## 28.5 HOW the Dispute Protocol Operates (STEP-BY-STEP)

### 28.5.1 Trigger

A dispute is triggered when:
- a challenger submits a reproducible objection,
- or a verification replay fails.

---

### 28.5.2 Freeze

Mechanism:
- the contested receipt is frozen,
- no edits, no extensions, no rewrites.

Purpose:
- prevent post-challenge contamination.

---

### 28.5.3 Independent Reconstruction

Mechanism:
- challenger and prover independently replay:
  - evidence,
  - sequence,
  - authority bindings.

No narratives allowed.
Only receipts.

---

### 28.5.4 Resolution

Outcomes:
- **Validated** — reconstruction succeeds.  
- **Qualified** — partial validity with limits recorded.  
- **Rejected** — reconstruction fails; claim collapses.

---

### 28.5.5 Ledger Binding

Mechanism:
- dispute outcome is sealed as a downstream DRS™ event,
- EVL™ records the conflict permanently.

Purpose:
- the system can never deny the dispute occurred.

---

## 28.6 HOW OPS™ and ASA™ Participate Under Attack

- OPS™ defines when disputes must trigger automatically.
- ASA™ supplies reproducible execution artifacts.
- DRS™ adjudicates truth without trust.

This separation ensures:
- automation does not judge itself,
- governance does not depend on explanation.

---

## 28.7 Institutional Readiness (WHY this matters)

Institutions adopt systems that:
- survive hostile scrutiny,
- fail transparently,
- and preserve history without revisionism.

DRS™ provides:
- survivable proof,
- not persuasive storytelling.

---

## 28.8 Canonical Statement

The Discovery Receipt Standard™ is TruthSeal’s defense against narrative power.

In TruthSeal™:
- discovery must **survive attack**,
- truth must **outlive conflict**,
- and legitimacy must be **reconstructable forever**.
