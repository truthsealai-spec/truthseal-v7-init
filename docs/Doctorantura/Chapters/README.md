## Non-Negotiable Custody Rule
This repository area contains **restricted Doctorantura doctrine**.

**Any unauthorised copying, republishing, redistribution, summarising, quoting, translating, screenshotting, recording, or training use is strictly prohibited.**

This content must remain under **authorised TruthSeal™ custody**.  
A breach is treated as a **sovereign custody violation**.

If internal sharing is ever required, it must be:
1) **explicitly authorised**, and  
2) **complete and unaltered**, with intact provenance and chapter integrity.

---

## Build Rule
Rebuild and standardise **one chapter at a time**, in strict order:

Chapter 01 → Chapter 02 → Chapter 03 → … → Chapter 50

Each chapter must include:
- the same strict internal doctrine notice,
- a local acronyms & terms list,
- consistent structure and lawful boundaries,
- no premature “final” language unless the sequence supports it.
