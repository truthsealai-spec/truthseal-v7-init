# TruthSeal™ Sovereign Compendium — Doctorantura Edition v1.0

## Canonical Working Folder
This folder is the controlled, internal Doctorantura workspace for rebuilding the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Compendium from **Chapter 01 through Chapter 50** under a single unified standard.

---

## Internal Doctrine Notice (STRICT)
This Doctorantura Edition content is **strictly confidential** and **not for public use**.

**Unauthorised copying, republishing, redistribution, summarising, quoting, screenshotting, or training use is strictly prohibited.**

This material must remain within **authorised TruthSeal™ custodianship only**.  
Any breach is treated as a **sovereign governance and custody violation**.

If a document must be shared internally, it must be shared only:
1) with explicit permission from TruthSeal™ custodians, and  
2) with intact provenance, custody context, and chapter integrity.

---

## Purpose of This Folder
1. Establish a clean canonical Doctorantura baseline independent of older mixed-standard chapter paths.  
2. Rebuild the full doctrine sequentially, with consistent structure, tone, and custody language.  
3. Ensure every chapter formalises lawful boundaries without premature “final” claims that contradict later chapters.  
4. Protect internal doctrine from uncontrolled leakage during the rebuild cycle.

---

## Operating Rule
We will rebuild one chapter at a time, in strict order:

- Chapter 01  
- Chapter 02  
- Chapter 03  
- …  
- Chapter 50  

Each chapter must:
- carry the Doctorantura header and strict notice,  
- include a local acronym list,  
- maintain consistent structure and closure signals,  
- avoid premature “final” language unless the numbered sequence supports it.
