# TruthSeal™ Doctorantura — THE SOVEREIGN ARC OF AGI FRAMEWORK v1.0

**STRICT INTERNAL DOCTRINE — NOT FOR PUBLIC USE**  
**UNAUTHORISED DISTRIBUTION IS PROHIBITED**

Owner: **TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)**  
Scope: **Chapter 01–Chapter 50 (Doctorantura Edition)**  
Status: **Internal rebuild and standardisation**

---

## 0.1 Custody Rule (Non-Negotiable)

This folder contains **restricted Doctorantura doctrine** for  
**THE SOVEREIGN ARC OF AGI FRAMEWORK v1.0**.

Any **unauthorised copying, republishing, redistribution, summarising, quoting, translating, screenshotting, recording, or training use** is **strictly prohibited**.

Content must remain under **authorised TruthSeal™ custody** only.  
Any leak, repost, or derivative publication outside authorised custody is treated as a:

- **sovereign custody breach**, and  
- **intellectual property violation** under the TruthSeal™ governance regime.

If internal sharing is ever required, it must be:

1. **Explicitly authorised by TruthSeal™ (HML-bound mandate)**, and  
2. **Complete and unaltered**, with intact provenance, chapter numbering, and receipts.

---

## 0.2 Build Discipline

Rebuild and standardise **one chapter at a time**, in strict order:

**Chapter 01 → Chapter 02 → … → Chapter 50**

Each Doctorantura chapter **must**:

- Use the **fixed header** and **fixed custody footer** from this README.  
- Include a **local acronyms & terms** section (compact, arrow-style list).  
- Declare its **purpose**, **scope**, and **public vs non-public boundary**.  
- Respect **LEI = 1** (no regression to weaker governance once a stronger doctrine is known).  
- Make the **non-compensatory rule** explicit: a single critical breach cannot be “averaged out”.

---

## 0.3 Relationship to Public Materials

This Doctorantura Edition is **not** the public “Compendium”.  

- Doctorantura = **classified sovereign doctrine** (internal custody, receipts required).  
- Future **public compendium / media materials** will be derived later,  
  with softened narrative and explicit public-use licensing.

Nothing in this folder is to be treated as public, educational, or training material  
without a **separate, explicit TruthSeal™ release**.

---

## 0.4 SnS, LnL, LEI = 1 and TQC Discipline

For each chapter:

- **SnS (Sense / Non-Sense):** text must be logically coherent and self-consistent.  
- **LnL (Logic / Non-Logic):** governance rules must be enforceable, not rhetorical.  
- **LEI = 1:** once a safer, more coherent rule is written, later chapters may **refine** it but must not **weaken** it.  
- **TQC alignment:** terminology and structure must remain compatible with the TruthSeal™  
  Temporal / Purity / Irreversibility invariants used elsewhere in the stack.

Chapters that fail these checks are **not** considered canon, even if they exist as files.

---

## 0.5 Folder Layout (Doctorantura)

- `docs/Doctorantura/README.md` — this file (custody + build rules).  
- `docs/Doctorantura/Chapters/Chapter_01_The_Need_for_Behaviour_in_AI_v1.0.md`  
- `docs/Doctorantura/Chapters/Chapter_02_…`  
- … up to …  
- `docs/Doctorantura/Chapters/Chapter_50_…`

Only this folder tree is to be treated as **Doctorantura canonical** for  
THE SOVEREIGN ARC OF AGI FRAMEWORK v1.0.
