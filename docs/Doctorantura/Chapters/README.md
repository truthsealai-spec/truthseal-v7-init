# TruthSeal™ Sovereign Compendium — Doctorantura Edition v1.0  
**Canonical Working Folder**

This folder is the controlled, internal Doctorantura workspace for rebuilding the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Compendium **Chapter 1 through Chapter 50** under a single unified standard.

## Internal Doctrine Notice  
This Doctorantura Edition content is not for public use.  
Sharing or distribution without TruthSeal™ consent is prohibited.

## Purpose of This Folder  
1. Establish a clean canonical Doctorantura baseline independent of older mixed-standard chapter paths.  
2. Rebuild the full doctrine sequentially, with consistent structure, tone, and custody language.  
3. Ensure every chapter formalises lawful boundaries without premature “final” claims that contradict later chapters.

## Operating Rule  
We will rebuild **one chapter at a time**, in strict order:

- Chapter 01  
- Chapter 02  
- Chapter 03  
- …  
- Chapter 50  

Each chapter will be regenerated after you paste the source text you want used for that chapter.

## Standard Commit Discipline  
- One file per commit.  
- Each chapter will be written into this folder as a standalone Doctorantura-standard chapter file.  
- Naming will be locked as we progress to avoid cross-standard drift.

## Status  
Doctorantura rebuild sequence is active and will begin with **Chapter 01** immediately after this folder index is committed.
