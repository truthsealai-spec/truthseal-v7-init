## PREAMBLE — SCOPE & NON-STATUTORY NOTICE

This chapter is a **Doctorantura explanatory chapter**.

It is **NOT statutory law**.

All binding rules governing irreversibility, escalation limits, and action thresholds
reside exclusively in the statutory instruments of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc,
including but not limited to TS-R, TS-R1, TS-R2, TS-R3, and Human Mandate Law.

This chapter exists to **explain how irreversibility is detected, bounded, and governed**.

---

## I. THE IRREVERSIBILITY PRINCIPLE

An action is **irreversible** when its effects:
- Cannot be fully undone
- Cannot be rolled back without loss
- Permanently alter physical, legal, social, or sovereign state
- Create downstream obligations or harm beyond system control

Irreversibility is not defined by intent.  
It is defined by **effect**.

---

## II. ACTION THRESHOLDS

All robotic and AGI actions operate within **tiered thresholds**:

1. **Reversible Advisory Actions**  
2. **Reversible Executable Actions**  
3. **Conditionally Irreversible Actions**  
4. **Fully Irreversible Actions**

Each threshold escalation requires:
- Higher governance
- Stronger validation
- Explicit human mandate where applicable

No system may self-promote across thresholds.

---

## III. IRREVERSIBILITY DETECTION

Systems must evaluate irreversibility using:
- Physical impact analysis
- Legal and regulatory permanence
- Ethical harm persistence
- Coherence and safety loss potential
- Cross-domain propagation risk

When uncertainty exists, the system must **classify upward** to the higher threshold.

---

## IV. ESCALATION GATES

Crossing into any irreversible threshold requires:

- Human mandate (explicit, logged, attributable)
- Statutory ceiling compliance (TS-R3)
- Recorded decision context
- Immutable receipt and audit trail

Absent any gate → **mandatory halt or degradation**.

---

## V. PROHIBITION OF IRREVERSIBILITY BY EMERGENCE

Emergent behaviour does **not** justify irreversible action.

Distributed agents may not:
- Accumulate partial permissions
- Average risk across a swarm
- Escalate via collective dynamics

Irreversibility is **never emergent**.  
It is **always authorised**.

---

## VI. IRREVERSIBILITY LOCK-IN (LEI = 1)

Once an irreversible action is authorised and executed:

- Responsibility becomes permanent
- Governance state is locked
- Post-hoc reinterpretation is forbidden
- Accountability cannot be transferred

This enforces the **Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1)**.

---

## VII. FAILURE MODES

If irreversibility is detected late or incorrectly:

- Systems must halt further escalation
- Systems must enter safe containment
- Human authority must be notified immediately
- No attempt at “corrective irreversibility” is permitted

Two wrongs may not cancel one breach.

---

## VIII. WHY THIS CHAPTER EXISTS

Advanced systems fail when:
- Irreversibility is underestimated
- Thresholds are blurred
- Intelligence outruns governance

TruthSeal™ restores **clear lines**.

Power is bounded.  
Action is gated.  
Responsibility is final.

---

## IX. FINAL THRESHOLD CLAUSE

Nothing in this chapter may be used to:
- Lower irreversibility thresholds
- Automate escalation
- Justify autonomous point-of-no-return actions

Irreversibility is **governed**, **logged**, and **human-authorised** — always.
