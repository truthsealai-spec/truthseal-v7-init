## 23.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines the Operational Prompts Standard™ (OPS™) as the doctrine that converts internal model mechanics into **sovereign, receipt-first governance obligations**.

If earlier chapters establish:
• cognition and reasoning,
• behavioural coherence,
• constitutional irreversibility,
• mandate binding,
• intervention authority,

then this chapter defines **how prompts themselves become enforceable law** rather than informal guidance.

OPS™ prevents silent drift between what a model *can* do and what it is *permitted* to do.

---

## 23.1 Definition

The Operational Prompts Standard™ (OPS™) is the TruthSeal™ discipline that specifies:

• which internal model mechanics must emit evidence,  
• how that evidence must be structured,  
• when failure becomes non-compensatory,  
• and how enforcement is triggered across the sovereign stack.

In TruthSeal™, prompts are not preferences.  
They are **operational obligations**.

---

## 23.2 Canonical Rule

An operational prompt is binding **only** when:

• it generates verifiable receipts, and  
• failure triggers irreversible restriction under LEI = 1™.

Performance in unrelated domains cannot compensate for missing prompt-derived evidence.

---

## 23.3 The Six Operational Prompts (Doctorantura Canon)

### 23.3.1 Probabilistic Distribution Audit Prompt

Mandate:  
In governed domains, record the selected output **and** the rejected high-probability alternatives.

Minimum receipts:
• Top-N candidate set  
• Probability mass distribution  
• Active mandate version  
• Model identity hash  
• Decision index reference  

Failure consequence:  
Missing distribution records trigger immediate audit restriction.

---

### 23.3.2 Parameter Hash Validation Prompt

Mandate:  
Every governed model state must emit a cryptographic identity hash bound to an epoch.

Minimum receipts:
• Model hash  
• Validation epoch  
• Guardian attestation  
• EVL™ pointer  
• QENC™ eligibility reference  

Failure consequence:  
Unexplained hash change suspends deployment authority.

---

### 23.3.3 Training Lineage Trace Prompt

Mandate:  
Training and fine-tuning used in governed systems must produce reconstructable lineage evidence.

Minimum receipts:
• Dataset registry references  
• Source classification  
• Filtering and sampling logic  
• Training epoch mapping  
• Lineage audit summary  

Failure consequence:  
Unverifiable lineage is treated as a critical governance breach.

---

### 23.3.4 Contextual Attention Isolation Prompt

Mandate:  
When coherence or intent gates are triggered, capture minimal influence traces sufficient for forensic reconstruction.

Minimum receipts:
• Trigger identifier  
• Top-K influence trace  
• Risk classification  
• Remediation action  
• EVL™ event reference  

Failure consequence:  
Repeated violations escalate restriction tier.

---

### 23.3.5 Non-Compensatory Logic Prompt

Mandate:  
Insufficient explanation in governed domains defaults to consequence-first enforcement.

Minimum receipts:
• Explanation threshold rule  
• Observed deficit record  
• Risk classification  
• Consequence tier assignment  
• CHS™ impact log  

Failure consequence:  
Opaque high-stakes decisions are treated as critical violations.

---

### 23.3.6 Moral Reward Alignment Prompt

Mandate:  
Reward and optimisation loops must prioritise sovereign purpose over engagement or utility maximisation.

Minimum receipts:
• Reward objective declaration  
• SIS™ binding reference  
• Training policy identifier  
• Stability evaluation evidence  
• Guardian attestation  

Failure consequence:  
Reward-purpose mismatch triggers immediate remedial gating.

---

## 23.4 HOW — Enforcement Path

OPS™ enforcement proceeds deterministically:

1. Prompt obligation is evaluated at runtime.  
2. Required receipts are checked for completeness.  
3. Failure routes to IIG™ and CHL™ evaluation.  
4. TGF™ enforces degrade, halt, or isolate.  
5. EVL™ records the event and QENC™ binds evidence.

No prompt failure is silent.

---

## 23.5 Integration With the Sovereign Stack

OPS™ binds directly into:
• SIS™ (purpose immutability),  
• IIG™ (drift enforcement),  
• CHL™ (authority circulation),  
• TGF™ (real-time intervention),  
• EVL™ (historical continuity),  
• QENC™ (sovereign proof).

OPS™ is the **measurement-to-law bridge**.

---

## 23.6 Canonical Statement

The Operational Prompts Standard™ transforms internal model behaviour into enforceable governance.

In TruthSeal™:
a prompt is not guidance.  
It is law when legitimacy depends on it.
