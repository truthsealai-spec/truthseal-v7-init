## 22.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines the Third Guardian Firewall™ (TGF™) as the **active sovereign conscience** of the TruthSeal™ architecture.

If prior chapters establish:
• coherence law,
• irreversible ethics,
• behavioural governance,
• receipt-first legitimacy,

then this chapter defines **how those laws are enforced at the moment of action**.

TGF™ exists so that intent cannot silently become execution when coherence, authority, or safety conditions are insufficient.

---

## 22.1 Definition

The Third Guardian Firewall™ (TGF™) is the **real-time intervention layer** that monitors intent, behaviour, coherence, privilege, and execution pathways.

It blocks, degrades, halts, isolates, or escalates actions that violate:
• TruthSeal™ law,
• coherence thresholds,
• mandate authority,
• or safety boundaries.

TGF™ is not advisory.  
It is **authoritative and pre-emptive**.

---

## 22.2 Position in the Sovereign Stack

TGF™ sits **between intent and execution**.

Its enforcement domain spans:
• NeuroVest™ (behavioural engine),
• TS-A1 AEGIS™ (hardware execution),
• TS-R1™ (single-robot action),
• TS-R2™ (swarm / fleet coordination),
• ASA™ (knowledge generation),
• CHS™ (coherence banding),
• Human Mandate Layer™ (authority).

No execution path bypasses TGF™.

---

## 22.3 What the Third Guardian Firewall™ Does

TGF™ performs five non-negotiable functions:

1. **Prevention**  
   Blocks prohibited or incoherent actions before execution.

2. **Degradation**  
   Forces downgraded, safe-mode execution when coherence is insufficient.

3. **Halt**  
   Executes immediate stop and escalation when risk exceeds tolerance.

4. **Isolation**  
   Quarantines agents or swarm members violating coherence (TS-R2™).

5. **Escalation & Recording**  
   Emits immutable events into EVL™ and binds evidence into QENC™.

This makes TGF™ the **disciplinary spine** of TruthSeal™.

---

## 22.4 HOW — Enforcement Mechanics (Core Requirement)

TGF™ operates through a deterministic enforcement sequence:

1. **Signal Ingestion**  
   Receives intent, behaviour, and execution requests from NeuroVest™, ASA™, robotics, or hardware lanes.

2. **Constraint Evaluation**  
   Evaluates against:
   • LEI = 1™ non-regression,
   • ULIC™ coherence bounds,
   • CHS™ operational band,
   • mandate authority via HML™,
   • receipt continuity.

3. **Decision Gate**  
   Determines one of five outcomes:
   • allow,
   • degrade,
   • pause,
   • halt,
   • isolate.

4. **Execution Control**  
   Enforces outcome through:
   • TS-A1 AEGIS™ (compute gating),
   • TS-R1™ (robot override),
   • TS-R2™ (swarm isolation).

5. **Receipt Emission**  
   Generates:
   • EVL™ event entry,
   • QENC™ binding reference,
   • human-readable rationale.

No step is optional.

---

## 22.5 Triggers for Intervention

TGF™ intervenes when any of the following occur:

• Attempted LEI = 1™ regression  
• Coherence erosion under ULIC™  
• CHS™ degradation to unsafe band  
• Mandate overreach or authority conflict  
• THT Protocol™ bypass attempt  
• QCEP™ epoch boundary violation  
• Hardware attestation failure (TS-A1™)

Intervention is immediate and irreversible until remediation.

---

## 22.6 Relationship With NeuroVest™

NeuroVest™ governs **how intelligence behaves**.  
TGF™ governs **whether behaviour is permitted**.

NeuroVest™ evolves conduct.  
TGF™ enforces consequence.

Together they ensure:
• privilege is earned,
• incoherence is punished,
• authority is bounded,
• and safety is structural.

---

## 22.7 Audit Visibility and Receipts

Every TGF™ action must produce:

• a minimal EVL™ event record,
• a QENC™-bindable evidence reference,
• a clear “why” explanation for sovereign review.

This guarantees:
• court reconstructability,
• historical traceability,
• and non-deniable intervention logic.

---

## 22.8 Canonical Statement

The Third Guardian Firewall™ is the sovereign conscience of TruthSeal™.

It ensures that:
• intelligence cannot outrun law,
• power cannot bypass coherence,
• and execution cannot occur without accountability.

Without TGF™, governance is theoretical.  
With TGF™, governance becomes **real-time law**.
