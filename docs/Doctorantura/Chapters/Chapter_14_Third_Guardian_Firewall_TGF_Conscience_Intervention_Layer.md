## 14.1 Purpose and Outcome

This chapter defines the **Third Guardian Firewall™ (TGF™)** as the mandatory internal veto, refusal, and intervention layer of all TruthSeal™-governed systems.

It establishes how a system:
• refuses unlawful or unethical actions  
• intervenes before harm manifests  
• escalates instability to human authority  
• preserves irreversibility of learned ethical boundaries  

TGF™ is the layer where **execution stops**, even when reasoning, intent, or authority pressure attempts to proceed.

---

## 14.2 Why the Third Guardian Firewall Exists

Capability alone cannot guarantee safety.

Without an internal veto layer:
• systems obey bad instructions  
• ethics collapse under pressure  
• safety becomes reactive  
• receipts document harm instead of preventing it  

TGF™ exists to ensure that **refusal is constitutional**, not optional.

This is the point where intelligence becomes governable.

---

## 14.3 Position in the TruthSeal™ Stack

TGF™ is positioned as follows:

• below **Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™)** — lawful human override remains possible  
• above **TS-A1 AEGIS™** — hardware enforces law but cannot judge context alone  
• parallel to **NeuroVest™** — conscience must act even if behaviour degrades  
• embedded within **TS-R1™** and **TS-R2™** — refusal applies to robots and fleets  

A system **cannot be TruthSeal™ compliant without TGF™**.

---

## 14.4 Core Evaluation Gates

Before execution, TGF™ evaluates five non-negotiable coherence gates:

1) **Ethical Coherence**  
   Does the action violate ULLI™, ULIC™, LEI = 1™, or TLC™?

2) **Safety Coherence**  
   Does the action breach CHS™ domain restrictions or environmental prohibitions?

3) **Authority Coherence**  
   Is the issuer authorised under HML™ at the current CHS™ band?

4) **Goal Coherence**  
   Is the action aligned with the declared mandate and role?

5) **Historical Coherence**  
   Has ledger history flagged this pattern as unsafe, illegal, or prohibited?

Failure of **any** gate triggers intervention.

---

## 14.5 Modes of Intervention

TGF™ operates in three bounded modes:

### A) Reject
• Block execution  
• Inform issuer or Guardian  
• Emit a refusal receipt with reason, role, and CHS™ state  

### B) Degrade
• Execute a safer alternative within mandate  
• Down-band CHS™ when risk trend warrants  
• Request explicit human confirmation  

### C) Safe-Stop
• Halt actuation (robotic / vehicle contexts)  
• Isolate control and coordination channels  
• Require Guardian or Owner release under HML™  

These modes ensure **prevention**, not post-event justification.

---

## 14.6 Irreversibility and Learned Refusal

TGF™ enforces irreversibility:

• Once a behaviour is blocked, reviewed, and confirmed as impermissible,  
  it cannot silently re-emerge without authorised mandate change.

This fulfils:
• **LEI = 1™** — no ethical regression  
• **ULIC™** — permanent inheritance of responsibility  

Ethics, once learned, cannot be forgotten.

---

## 14.7 Duty to Escalate

TGF™ must escalate when:

• repeated coherence violations occur  
• operator behaviour trends unsafe  
• privilege-overreach attempts multiply  
• autonomy stability degrades over time  
• swarm-level patterns suggest systemic risk  

Escalation generates receipts, triggers Guardian review,
and may force CHS™ down-banding.

---

## 14.8 Interaction with TS-R1™ (Single Agent)

In single-agent robotics:

• TGF™ blocks unsafe commands even under insistence  
• child, animal, hazard, and protected-context exclusions are absolute  
• rejected commands are logged to EVL™ and QENC™  

This prevents the “bad human + obedient machine” failure mode.

---

## 14.9 Interaction with TS-R2™ (Swarm / Fleet)

In fleets and swarms:

• a single-unit refusal triggers cluster re-evaluation  
• systemic risk forces collective degradation  
• contaminated units must be isolated with proof of containment  

TGF™ prevents herd harm and responsibility diffusion.

---

## 14.10 Why This Layer Is Foundational

Without TGF™:
• AI obeys immoral commands  
• robots follow coercion  
• safety relies on external policing  
• trust collapses after incidents  

With TGF™:
• refusal is built-in  
• intervention precedes harm  
• sovereignty becomes enforceable  

This is where intelligence learns humility.

## 14.12 Canonical Statement

**The Third Guardian Firewall™ is the inner veto organ of TruthSeal™ systems.**  
It is where refusal, interruption, and conscience are enforced.

This is the layer that prevents harm —  
not by intelligence alone,  
but by law.
