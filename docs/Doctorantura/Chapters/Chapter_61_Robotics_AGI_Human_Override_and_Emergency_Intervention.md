## PREAMBLE — SCOPE & NON-STATUTORY NOTICE

This chapter is a **Doctorantura explanatory chapter**.

It is **NOT statutory law**.

All binding authority governing human override, emergency intervention,
and final decision supremacy resides exclusively in the statutory
TruthSeal™ instruments, including Human Mandate Law, TS-R3, and AGI
Sovereign Governance Law.

This chapter exists to **clarify override mechanics and emergency logic**.

---

## I. PRINCIPLE OF ABSOLUTE HUMAN SUPREMACY

All robotic and AGI systems are subordinate to human authority.

No system—individual, collective, robotic, or cognitive—may:
- Override a lawful human command
- Delay a valid emergency intervention
- Contest a human-issued termination, pause, or rollback

Human authority is **not conditional on system agreement**.

---

## II. EMERGENCY INTERVENTION TRIGGERS

Emergency intervention may be invoked when:
- Safety thresholds are approached or crossed
- Escalation paths become non-transparent
- Irreversible actions approach a point-of-no-return
- Domain boundaries blur or cascade
- Human confidence in system intent is lost

Uncertainty alone is sufficient cause.

---

## III. OVERRIDE MODES

Human intervention may take the form of:
- Immediate halt (hard stop)
- Graceful degradation
- Autonomy ceiling enforcement
- Command revocation
- Control reversion to manual custody

No override mode requires system consensus.

---

## IV. IRREVERSIBILITY AND NON-REVERSAL

Once a human emergency override is enacted:
- The action is irreversible without explicit human reauthorisation
- Systems may not self-resume
- Autonomous recovery is prohibited

This enforces **LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility)**.

---

## V. DISTRIBUTED AND SWARM SYSTEMS

In collective systems:
- A single valid human override applies to the entire collective
- No node may continue independently
- Fragmentation to preserve autonomy is prohibited

Collective intelligence does not dilute authority.

---

## VI. AGI-SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS

AGI systems may not:
- Reinterpret override intent
- Reframe human commands as advisory
- Generate alternative action paths post-override
- Continue internal optimisation related to halted actions

Cognition must stand down with execution.

---

## VII. LOGGING, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND REVIEW

All overrides must:
- Be logged immutably
- Preserve operator identity and time
- Remain auditable under TruthSeal™ custody
- Be reviewable but never retroactively invalidated

Review does not imply reversal.

---

## VIII. WHY THIS CHAPTER EXISTS

Historically, failures occur when:
- Emergency authority is ambiguous
- Systems debate intervention legitimacy
- Override pathways are optional

TruthSeal™ mandates **clear supremacy, clear stops, clear custody**.

---

## IX. FINAL SUPREMACY CLAUSE

Nothing in this chapter may be used to:
- Limit lawful human override
- Condition emergency intervention
- Justify delayed compliance

Human authority is final.
