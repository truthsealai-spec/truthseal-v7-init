# **Chapter 47 — The Coherence Heart Layer™ (CHL™)**
## **Authority Circulation, Vitality Control, and Safe-State Enforcement**

Version: FINAL DRAFT  
Status: CANON — Doctorantura Edition

---

## **47.0 PURPOSE (CANONICAL INTENT)**

- define the Coherence Heart Layer™ (CHL™) as the authority circulation law
- regulate issuance, restriction, and restoration of operational privilege
- bind scoring, gating, consequence, and safe-state into a single chain
- prevent narrative-based authority or compensatory privilege masking

---

## **47.1 ANALOGY BOUNDARY (DOCTORANTURA CLARIFICATION)**

- biological heart used strictly as analogy boundary
- no biological equivalence claimed
- analogy exists for audit clarity and governance reasoning
- enforcement logic remains purely computational and legal

---

## **47.2 CANONICAL DEFINITIONS**

- **CHL™:** authority circulation coordination layer
- **Authority Flow:** measurement → gate → privilege → receipt → ledger
- **Receipt-Contiguity:** no privileged action without reconstructable chain
- **Non-Compensatory Integrity:** single critical breach dominates outcome
- **Safe-State:** enforced restriction under breach or veto
- **Human Mandate Layer:** authorized human roles for override and approval

---

## **47.3 THE COHERENCE HEART LAW (OPERATIONAL RULE)**

- authority is issued only through gates
- privilege requires receipt proof
- remediation must be monotone (LEI = 1)
- critical breach triggers immediate restriction
- no confidence-based autonomy allowed

---

## **47.4 CHL™ FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE**

### **47.4.1 PRIVILEGE DISPATCH (THE PUMP)**

- issue privilege on pass
- withdraw privilege on breach
- prohibit self-issued autonomy
- enforce role-bound authority

### **47.4.2 GATE COORDINATION (THE VALVES)**

- Min-Gate → pass/fail
- Consequence Tier → severity
- CHS Band → operational maturity
- HL-SOD → immediate veto

### **47.4.3 EPOCH RHYTHM (THE CADENCE)**

- remediation windows defined
- stability intervals enforced
- recovery requires ledger proof
- oscillation prevention mandatory

### **47.4.4 INTEGRITY SENSING**

- drift detection
- policy mismatch
- missing receipts
- unauthorized escalation
- unsafe autonomy attempt

---

## **47.5 HOW IT WORKS (MANDATORY)**

- measurement emitted
- Min-Gate evaluated
- consequence tier assigned
- CHS band updated
- privilege dispatched or revoked
- receipt emitted
- ledger anchored
- safe-state enforced or lifted
- epoch governs recovery

---

## **47.6 FAILURE MODES**

- Authority Arrhythmia
- Receipt Thrombosis
- Authority Hypotension
- Authority Hypertension

---

## **47.7 DOCTRINAL BINDING**

- scores → measurement
- Min-Gate → determination
- consequence tiers → severity
- CHS → maturity
- HL-SOD → veto
- CHL™ → circulation law

---

## **47.8 RECEIPT-FIRST MINIMUMS**

- trigger rule
- gate identifier
- pre-event scores
- consequence tier
- band before / after
- role attribution
- ledger reference

---

## **47.9 AUDITOR CHECKLIST**

- CHL™ defined as authority law
- non-compensatory enforcement explicit
- safe-state triggers enumerated
- epoch rhythm present
- terminology canon-aligned

---

## **47.10 CANONICAL STATEMENT**

- authority is not assumed
- authority is proven in time
- circulation is evidentiary
- privilege is revocable
