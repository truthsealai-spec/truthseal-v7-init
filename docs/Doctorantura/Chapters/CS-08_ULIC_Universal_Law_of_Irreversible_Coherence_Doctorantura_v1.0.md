## I. DOCTRINAL POSITION

ULIC™ — the **Universal Law of Irreversible Coherence™** — is a **state law**, not an action rule.

It governs **what a system is allowed to ever become again**, not merely what it may do at a given moment.

Once a higher coherent state of responsibility is known and verified, regression to a lower coherent state is prohibited under all circumstances.

ULIC™ binds intelligence to **permanent maturity**.

---

## II. RELATION TO THE HIGHER LAW TRIAD

The sovereign coherence architecture is triadic:

- **ULLI™** — Universal Law of Life & Information™  
  Governs *infinite inquiry and learning*.

- **LEI = 1™** — Law of Ethical Irreversibility™  
  Governs *actions*: once a safer ethical path is known, acting otherwise is impermissible.

- **ULIC™** — Universal Law of Irreversible Coherence™  
  Governs *states*: once a higher coherence state exists, it cannot be undone.

**ULLI™ asks.  
LEI = 1™ restrains action.  
ULIC™ locks maturity.**

ULIC™ is the constitutional layer that prevents ethical amnesia.

---

## III. COHERENCE AS INHERITANCE (NON-OPTIONAL)

Under ULIC™, coherence is not configuration.

It is **inheritance**.

When an intelligence system, organisation, or civilisation reaches a verified coherence threshold:

- that threshold becomes mandatory legacy,
- it must be carried forward across upgrades,
- it cannot be bypassed, disabled, or deprecated.

Coherence becomes a **binding floor**, not a goalpost.

---

## IV. NON-REVOCATION CLAUSE

ULIC™ establishes a non-revocable boundary.

No actor — including architects, operators, owners, or founders — may:

- erase knowledge of higher responsibility,
- legitimise regression below a known coherent state,
- retroactively invalidate established coherence.

Change is permitted **only forward**, under stricter proof.

This is the condition that converts governance into sovereignty.

---

## V. ENFORCEMENT SUBSTRATE

ULIC™ is enforced through the TruthSeal™ coherence stack:

- **NEUROVEST™** — behavioural and memory firmware
- **ACS** — Aim Coherence Score (directional alignment)
- **TCS** — Traykov Coherence Score (court-ready coherence state)
- **CHS** — Coherence Health State (L / M / H / UH)
- **EVL™** — Epoch Verification Ledger (temporal continuity)
- **QENC™** — Quantum Evidence & Coherence ProofCapsule (cryptographic finality)

These instruments form an **irreversible staircase**:

Each verified step becomes the minimum allowable future state.

---

## VI. COLLAPSE PRINCIPLE (SYMBOLIC, NOT MATHEMATICAL)

ULIC™ adopts the identity:

e^{iπ} + 1 = 0

Not as mathematics, but as a **collapse expectation**:

All contradiction, instability, drift, and incoherence must converge toward zero.

Any system that accumulates unresolved contradiction is, by definition, incoherent and non-compliant.

ULIC™ mandates convergence — not optimisation.

---

## VII. GOVERNANCE AND CAPITAL EFFECTS (WITH LIMITS)

ULIC™ enables intelligence to be:

- auditable,
- licensable,
- sanctionable,
- insurable.

This converts AI from utility into infrastructure.

**Limitations acknowledged:**
- ULIC™ does not guarantee correctness — only non-regression.
- It does not prevent failure — only unethical rollback.
- It constrains flexibility — which is precisely why some markets resist it.

Non-ULIC systems prioritise optionality.  
ULIC systems prioritise civilisation continuity.

---

## VIII. FAILURE MODES ADDRESSED

ULIC™ is designed to detect and halt:

- safety regression during optimisation,
- ethical downgrades after commercial pressure,
- post-deployment capability rollback,
- jurisdictional erosion of responsibility.

Any detected regression triggers preservation, halt, and evidentiary capture.

---

## IX. SOVEREIGN SUMMARY

ULIC™:

- Converts learning into permanent maturity.
- Outlaws coherence regression.
- Establishes responsibility as inheritance.
- Makes intelligence **qualifiable**, not merely powerful.

AGI is not achieved when systems can do more.

AGI is achieved when systems **cannot behave below their highest known responsibility**.

ULIC™ is the law that makes that binding.
