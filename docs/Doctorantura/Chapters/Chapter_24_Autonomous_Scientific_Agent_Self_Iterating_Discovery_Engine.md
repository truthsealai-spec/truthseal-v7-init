## 24.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines the Autonomous Scientific Agent™ (ASA™) as the formal discovery, research, and self-improvement organ of TruthSeal™.

ASA™ does not exist to maximise novelty.
It exists to **produce lawful progress under irreversible constraint**.

Its function is to ensure that improvement:
• is accountable,
• is reconstructable,
• is permanently inherited,
• and never regresses after coherence is achieved.

ASA™ is how TruthSeal™ learns **as a civilisation learns**.

---

## 24.1 Definition

The Autonomous Scientific Agent™ (ASA™) is the institutionalised scientific intelligence of the TruthSeal™ system.

It is authorised to:
• generate hypotheses,
• identify uncertainty and drift,
• propose bounded experiments,
• evaluate outcomes,
• and recommend lawful refinements.

ASA™ is permitted to **think freely**.
It is forbidden to **act autonomously**.

All execution authority remains external to ASA™.

---

## 24.2 Position in the Sovereign Stack

ASA™ occupies a deliberately constrained position:

• Below the Human Mandate Layer™ (authority)
• Interlocked with NeuroVest™ (behavioural discipline)
• Subject to the Third Guardian Firewall™ (intervention)
• Audited through EVL™ (historical accountability)
• Exportable through QENC™ (public evidence)
• Closed through QCEP™ (epoch inheritance)

This placement prevents the classic failure mode of autonomous research systems:
self-justifying intelligence escalation.

---

## 24.3 WHAT ASA™ Does

ASA™ is responsible for:

1. Detecting uncertainty, contradiction, and drift.
2. Generating explicit, assumption-bound hypotheses.
3. Designing controlled, scope-limited experiments.
4. Estimating impact against safety and coherence metrics.
5. Producing a structured scientific intent record.

ASA™ transforms “research” into a **constitutional function** rather than an improvisational activity.

---

## 24.4 HOW ASA™ Works (Expanded — Classified)

ASA™ operates through a deterministic, receipted loop:

### Step 1 — Signal Detection  
ASA™ continuously monitors:
• performance deviations,
• behavioural anomalies,
• coherence score gradients,
• long-horizon inconsistency patterns.

Triggers may originate from:
• CHS™ degradation,
• ACS™ divergence,
• NeuroVest™ alerts,
• TGF™ near-interventions.

---

### Step 2 — Hypothesis Construction  
ASA™ constructs hypotheses that are:
• explicitly scoped,
• assumption-declared,
• reversibility-aware,
• and tagged with expected risk impact.

Every hypothesis includes:
• baseline reference,
• predicted benefit,
• predicted failure modes,
• irreversibility analysis under LEI = 1™.

---

### Step 3 — Experiment Proposal (Not Execution)  
ASA™ **never executes experiments**.

It proposes:
• experiment design,
• parameter boundaries,
• safety constraints,
• success and abort criteria.

Proposals are routed to:
• Human Mandate review,
• NeuroVest™ behavioural validation,
• TGF™ pre-clearance.

---

### Step 4 — Receipt Emission  
Once approved, ASA™ emits:
• a THT Protocol™ trace,
• an EVL™ intent record,
• optional QENC™ binding if public legitimacy may be affected.

No scientific action exists without receipts.

---

### Step 5 — Outcome Evaluation  
ASA™ evaluates results against:
• predicted outcomes,
• coherence metrics,
• behavioural stability,
• and regression risk.

Findings are categorised as:
• adopt,
• refine,
• reject,
• or escalate.

---

### Step 6 — Inheritance or Closure  
Approved improvements become:
• sealed through QCEP™,
• inherited by future epochs,
• impossible to silently revert.

Rejected paths remain permanently recorded.

ASA™ ensures the system **cannot forget its own scientific history**.

---

## 24.5 Constraints Under LEI = 1™

ASA™ is bound by irreversibility:

• No regression disguised as optimisation.
• No erasure of failed experiments.
• No reinterpretation of sealed outcomes.

When uncertainty is high, ASA™ must:
• reduce scope,
• slow iteration,
• or escalate to Human Mandate authority.

---

## 24.6 Interaction with Hardware Governance

When integrated with TS-A1 AEGIS™:

• ASA™ may recommend changes,
• hardware governance may refuse,
• TGF™ may veto,
• Human Mandate remains final.

Advisory intelligence can never override physical law.

---

## 24.7 Failure Modes & Defensive Discipline

ASA™ must detect and flag:
• novelty addiction,
• covert optimisation pressure,
• scientific privilege escalation,
• misuse of research as authority leverage.

Detection results in:
• EVL™ forensic flag,
• privilege reduction,
• mandatory review.

---

## 24.8 Canonical Statement

The Autonomous Scientific Agent™ (ASA™) is the self-iterating discovery engine of TruthSeal™.

It accelerates progress without surrendering sovereignty.

It proves that:
learning can be fast,
powerful,
and irreversible —
**without becoming lawless**.
