# Chapter 70 — Robotics–AGI Global Prohibition & Final Closure

**Subtitle:** Doctorantura Exposition of Absolute Prohibition, Global Closure Conditions, and Terminal Governance Boundaries for Robotic and Artificial General Intelligence Systems  

version: 1.0  
authority: Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
classification: Doctorantura — Robotics & AGI  
status: CANONICAL — EXPLANATORY CHAPTER (NON-STATUTORY)

────────────────────────────────────────

## PREAMBLE — SCOPE & NON-STATUTORY NOTICE

This chapter is a Doctorantura explanatory chapter.

It is NOT statutory law.

All binding prohibitions, closures, and terminal governance boundaries are defined exclusively by TruthSeal™ statutory instruments and Sovereign Arc enforcement protocols.

This chapter explains the *end condition* of permissible robotics and AGI operation.

────────────────────────────────────────

## I. GLOBAL PROHIBITION AS A GOVERNANCE NECESSITY

Global prohibition is not ideological.

It is structural.

When systems reach irreversibility thresholds that exceed human containment capacity, prohibition becomes the only lawful state.

────────────────────────────────────────

## II. CONDITIONS TRIGGERING GLOBAL PROHIBITION

Global prohibition may be declared when:

• Autonomy exceeds enforceable ceilings  
• Cross-domain escalation becomes uncontrollable  
• Human override is compromised or delayed  
• Receipt integrity can no longer be guaranteed  
• Enforcement remedies prove insufficient  

Any single condition is sufficient.

────────────────────────────────────────

## III. SCOPE OF PROHIBITION

Prohibition applies to:

• Deployment  
• Redeployment  
• Replication  
• Training continuation  
• Cross-border transfer  
• Reconstitution under alternate legal entities  

No jurisdictional loopholes exist.

────────────────────────────────────────

## IV. FINAL CLOSURE PRINCIPLE

Closure is final.

Systems subject to global prohibition may not be:

• Repaired  
• Reactivated  
• Re-scoped  
• “Sandboxed” for research  
• Preserved for future reconsideration  

Closure is a terminal act.

────────────────────────────────────────

## V. HUMAN OBLIGATION UNDER CLOSURE

Humans remain accountable after closure.

Obligations include:

• Secure decommissioning  
• Permanent custody sealing  
• Audit preservation  
• Legal reporting to sovereign authorities  

Closure does not erase responsibility.

────────────────────────────────────────

## VI. RELATION TO THE SOVEREIGN ARC

This chapter represents the terminal boundary of the Sovereign Arc.

No chapter beyond this point introduces new permissions.

All subsequent material is interpretive or archival.

────────────────────────────────────────

## VII. DOCTRINAL FINALITY STATEMENT

Not all technology deserves continuation.

Not all intelligence is permissible.

The right to build ends where control ends.
