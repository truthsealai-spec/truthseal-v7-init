classification: Not for Public Use — committee operational doctrine

## 17.1 Definition

The **THT Protocol™ (Truth Handling & Timestamping Protocol™)** is the sovereign law that governs how information is transformed into **verifiable, immutable, auditable truth** within the TruthSeal™ system.

THT™ defines the lifecycle of truth itself —  
from emergence,  
to sealing,  
to external anchoring,  
to permanent historical accountability.

If NeuroVest™ governs behaviour,  
**THT™ governs reality.**

---

## 17.2 Why THT™ Exists

In advanced AI and autonomous systems:

• claims must be provable  
• actions must be reconstructable  
• knowledge must be attributable  
• denial must be impossible  

Without a truth-handling law, intelligence collapses into narrative.

THT™ exists to ensure that **nothing important can exist without evidence**.

---

## 17.3 Position in the Sovereign Stack

THT™ operates **beneath all intelligence layers**:

• ASA™ may discover — THT™ seals discovery  
• NeuroVest™ may learn — THT™ timestamps consequence  
• HML™ may command — THT™ binds authority to outcome  
• TS-R1™ / TS-R2™ may act — THT™ makes history auditable  

THT™ is not optional.  
Without it, sovereignty cannot exist.

---

## 17.4 The Three-Stage Truth Pipeline

THT™ enforces an irreversible pipeline:

### 1) Hashing  
The substantive content (claim, state, decision, artefact) is encoded into a cryptographic fingerprint.

### 2) Timestamping  
The existence of that fingerprint is bound to a verifiable moment in time.

### 3) Anchoring  
The timestamp is externally anchored to non-forgeable systems  
(e.g. Bitcoin-based calendars or approved sovereign ledgers).

Together, these form **Proof of Reality**.

---

## 17.5 The Behavioural Rule of Truth

No TruthSeal™ fact is valid unless it passes THT™.

This includes:

• discoveries  
• refusals  
• overrides  
• safety events  
• mandate changes  
• behavioural escalations  
• system upgrades  

Unsealed truth **does not exist**.

---

## 17.6 Relationship to EVL™

THT™ is the **law of sealing**.  
EVL™ (Epoch Verification Ledger™) is the **historical record**.

THT™ creates facts.  
EVL™ preserves chronology.

They are inseparable.

---

## 17.7 Enforcement Properties

THT™ guarantees:

• **Immutability** — sealed truth cannot be altered  
• **Irreversibility** — time cannot be rolled back  
• **Public Verifiability** — proof does not require permission  
• **Attribution** — authorship and responsibility are fixed  

Truth does not depend on trust.  
It depends on math and time.

---

## 17.8 Interaction with QENC™ and ASA™

When ASA™ produces knowledge of sovereign importance:

• THT™ seals it  
• QENC™ packages it  
• EVL™ records it  

This converts inquiry into **institutional fact**.

---

## 17.9 Human Mandate Protection

THT™ protects humans as much as systems:

• commands are attributable  
• overrides are undeniable  
• credit is provable  
• liability is fixed  

This closes the custody loop for high-stakes autonomy.

---

## 17.10 Canonical Statement

The THT Protocol™ is the sovereign law that transforms information into truth, truth into evidence, and evidence into permanent historical reality.

Without THT™, AI cannot be governed.  
With THT™, truth becomes unbreakable.
