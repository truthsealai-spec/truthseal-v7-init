## 15.1 Purpose and Outcome

This chapter defines the **Autonomous Scientific Agent™ (ASA™)** as the governed mechanism by which intelligence performs discovery, inference, modelling, testing, correction, and explanation **without escaping sovereignty**.

ASA™ converts infinite inquiry into **lawful, receipted, non-regressive knowledge evolution** under:

• Human Mandate authority  
• Third Guardian refusal and intervention  
• NeuroVest™ behavioural discipline  
• LEI = 1™ and ULIC™ irreversibility  

ASA™ is not free exploration.  
It is **licensed discovery**.

---

## 15.2 Definition

The Autonomous Scientific Agent™ is the TruthSeal™ construct that enables an AI system to:

• generate hypotheses  
• evaluate evidence  
• test models  
• revise conclusions  
• declare uncertainty  
• settle findings  

**only within authorised domains**, and **only with full audit continuity**.

ASA™ governs how intelligence *learns*, not how it *acts*.

---

## 15.3 Position in the Sovereign Stack

ASA™ operates within strict boundaries:

• below the **Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™)**, which defines lawful scope  
• bounded by the **Third Guardian Firewall™ (TGF™)**, which enforces refusal  
• disciplined by **NeuroVest™**, which preserves humility and consequence memory  
• subject to **CHS™ privilege ceilings**  

ASA™ executes inquiry under law, not curiosity.

---

## 15.4 Governed Inquiry Law

ASA™ operationalises the ULLI™ inquiry principle:

Q = 5W + H + n = D + A = ∞

But under constraint:

• inquiry must not violate mandate  
• exploration must not exceed CHS™ band  
• discovery must not bypass ethical gates  
• uncertainty must be declared as UNKNOWN  

This prevents uncontrolled experimentation.

---

## 15.5 Core Governed Capabilities

ASA™ must implement the following capabilities:

1) **Hypothesis Formation**  
   Generates candidate explanations only when coherence preconditions are satisfied.

2) **Model Construction and Testing**  
   Uses simulation, data, precedent, and receipts to evaluate validity.

3) **Uncertainty Declaration**  
   If evidence is insufficient, ASA™ must explicitly state **UNKNOWN**.

4) **Iterative Correction**  
   Refines conclusions using feedback from NeuroVest™, TCS™, ACS™, CHS™, and ledger history.

5) **Teach-Back and Explainability**  
   Provides structured explanation suitable for audit by HML™ roles.

6) **Safety-Gated Discovery**  
   Prohibited domains remain inaccessible regardless of capability.

7) **Settlement and Canonicalisation**  
   Mature findings may be sealed via EVL™ and QENC™ ProofCapsules.

---

## 15.6 Irreversibility of Knowledge

ASA™ inherits irreversibility:

• Once a finding is sealed as coherent,  
  it cannot be discarded for convenience.

Regression is permitted **only** if:

• a coherence-superior proof emerges, and  
• Human Mandate authorises revision.

This prevents scientific amnesia and narrative drift.

---

## 15.7 ASA™ and NeuroVest™

NeuroVest™ governs **character**:
• humility  
• foresight  
• consequence memory  

ASA™ governs **thinking**:
• modelling  
• testing  
• correction  
• explanation  

Discovery without character is unsafe.  
Therefore ASA™ is invalid without NeuroVest™ active.

---

## 15.8 Interaction with Execution Layers

ASA™ may:

• inform TS-A1 AEGIS™ decisions  
• advise TS-R1™ robotic adaptation  
• contribute shared knowledge to TS-R2™ fleets  

ASA™ may not:

• directly execute physical actions  
• override CHS™ privilege limits  
• bypass Third Guardian refusal  

Knowledge does not equal permission.

---

## 15.9 Why ASA™ Is Necessary

Without ASA™:

• systems stagnate  
• correction is external  
• errors persist  
• adaptation is slow  

With ASA™:

• intelligence can improve itself  
• errors are detected early  
• explanations remain auditable  
• learning stays sovereign  

ASA™ is **capability without escape**.

---

## 15.10 Canonical Statement

**The Autonomous Scientific Agent™ is the governed intelligence organ that converts infinite inquiry into safe, auditable knowledge evolution.**

It enables discovery  
without surrendering sovereignty.
