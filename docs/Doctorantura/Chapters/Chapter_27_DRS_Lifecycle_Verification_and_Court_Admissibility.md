## 27.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines **how a Discovery Receipt™ moves through time** from inception to court-admissible fact.

Where Chapter 26 defines **what a receipt contains**,  
this chapter defines **how that receipt lives, is tested, verified, challenged, and survives institutional scrutiny**.

Under TruthSeal™, a receipt is not static evidence.  
It is a **living lifecycle object** whose legitimacy depends on continued coherence.

---

## 27.1 Core Rule — Lifecycle Supremacy

A Discovery Receipt™ is legitimate **only while**:

1. its lifecycle remains unbroken,  
2. its verification states remain reproducible, and  
3. its ledger bindings remain intact.

If any lifecycle phase collapses, admissibility collapses.

---

## 27.2 The DRS™ Lifecycle (WHAT phases exist)

Every Discovery Receipt™ passes through **five irreversible phases**:

1. Intent Binding  
2. Execution Capture  
3. Integrity Sealing  
4. Verification & Challenge  
5. Admissibility & Reliance  

Each phase is **monotone under LEI = 1™**.

---

## 27.3 HOW the Lifecycle Is Executed (MECHANICS)

### 27.3.1 Phase I — Intent Binding (HOW intent is frozen)

Before execution, the system must:

- instantiate a DRS™ draft object,
- bind mandate, scope, and authority hashes,
- record allowed methods and exclusions.

Mechanically:
- intent fields are hashed,
- hashes are locked,
- post-execution edits are cryptographically impossible.

This prevents retroactive justification.

---

### 27.3.2 Phase II — Execution & Evidence Capture (HOW evidence is collected)

During discovery execution:

- all inputs are hashed at ingestion,
- intermediate states are indexed,
- failed paths are optionally recorded,
- interventions are time-stamped with role attribution.

Mechanically:
- OPS™ enforces capture triggers,
- ASA™ streams structured evidence into the receipt object,
- TGF™ may halt or narrow execution in real time.

---

### 27.3.3 Phase III — Integrity Sealing (HOW mutation is stopped)

Upon completion:

- the receipt is canonically serialised,
- a final integrity hash is computed,
- internal consistency checks are executed,
- LEI = 1™ regression scan is performed.

Mechanically:
- once sealed, the receipt becomes immutable,
- any modification requires a **new receipt** that references the prior one.

---

### 27.3.4 Phase IV — Verification & Challenge (HOW truth is tested)

Verification occurs when:

- an independent party replays the receipt,
- evidence hashes reproduce identically,
- methods match authorised scope,
- results follow from the recorded chain.

Mechanically:
- verification does not rely on explanation,
- only on reconstruction.

Challenges are handled by:
- flagging discrepancies,
- recording challenge receipts,
- preserving the original receipt unaltered.

---

### 27.3.5 Phase V — Admissibility & Reliance (HOW courts and institutions rely)

A receipt becomes admissible when:

- verification passes,
- challenge windows are resolved or recorded,
- EVL™ settlement is confirmed.

Mechanically:
- admissibility is a **status flag**, not an opinion,
- institutions rely on the receipt by reference, not trust.

---

## 27.4 HOW DRS™ Is Bound to EVL™

### 27.4.1 Settlement Mechanics

The sealed receipt hash is submitted to EVL™ with:

- epoch identifier,
- parent receipt references,
- classification flags.

EVL™ assigns:
- timestamp,
- ordering,
- immutability.

---

### 27.4.2 Temporal Sovereignty

Once settled:
- the receipt becomes historical fact,
- later receipts may extend it,
- none may overwrite it.

This enforces civilisational memory.

---

## 27.5 HOW Court Admissibility Is Achieved (TruthSeal Sense)

TruthSeal™ admissibility requires:

- reconstructability without narrative,
- reproducibility without author presence,
- integrity without institutional trust.

Mechanically:
- courts receive receipts,
- not expert testimony as primary proof,
- testimony only explains, never substitutes.

---

## 27.6 Failure Semantics (HOW legitimacy collapses)

A receipt loses admissibility if:

- evidence cannot be replayed,
- hashes fail to reproduce,
- scope violations are proven,
- authority is invalidated.

Mechanically:
- failure is logged,
- consequence tiers activate,
- the receipt remains preserved as failed history.

---

## 27.7 Canonical Statement

The Discovery Receipt Standard™ is the mechanism by which TruthSeal™ converts discovery into **time-stable truth**.

A discovery is not believed.  
It is **replayed, verified, and admitted**.
