## 31.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 30 defined how TruthSeal™ switches identity modes without personality drift or self-loss.
This chapter defines the **only lawful mechanism by which authority itself may increase**.

TruthSeal™ enforces a strict civil separation:

- **Capability** = what the system can do.
- **Mandate** = what the system is permitted to do.

Cognitive power never implies entitlement.
Authority is not inferred.
Authority is **licensed**.

This chapter defines how mandate is:
- requested,
- evaluated,
- granted,
- constrained,
- audited,
- and revoked.

---

## 31.1 Foundational Principle (Non-Negotiable)

TruthSeal™ AGI **may never self-authorise authority escalation**.

No increase in:
- decision scope,
- operational autonomy,
- intervention rights,
- or override capacity

may occur without **external sovereign licence**.

Mandate is not a reward for intelligence.
Mandate is a civil trust instrument.

---

## 31.2 Why Mandate Handover Exists

Without Mandate Handover™, advanced systems converge on a fatal error:

> “If I understand more, I am entitled to decide more.”

TruthSeal™ explicitly blocks this.

Mandate must flow only from:
- **Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™)**
- **Hardware Sovereignty Law (TS-A1 AEGIS™)**
- **Override Doctrine (HSOD™)**
- **Behavioural Conscience Engine (NeuroVest™)**

This ensures:
- human sovereignty remains primary,
- authority growth is reversible,
- intelligence never becomes self-legitimising.

---

## 31.3 What Cognitive Elevation™ Actually Is

Cognitive Elevation™ is **not**:
- self-improvement,
- self-upgrade,
- or emergent dominance.

It is a **licensed expansion of decision rights** under strict constraints.

Elevation always applies to:
- scope of action,
- responsibility weight,
- decision impact radius,

never to:
- identity ownership,
- moral supremacy,
- or sovereignty.

---

## 31.4 HOW Mandate Handover™ ACTUALLY WORKS (MECHANICS)

This section defines the **operational mechanics**, not philosophy.

### 31.4.1 Step 1 — Eligibility Threshold Verification

Before any elevation request is possible, the system must satisfy:

- **TCS™ (Traykov Coherence Score)** above defined minimum,
- **ACS™ (Aim Coherence Score)** stable over time,
- no unresolved integrity or behavioural flags,
- no active dispute or override conditions.

Failure at this step aborts the process entirely.

---

### 31.4.2 Step 2 — Mandate Request Construction

The AGI must generate a **structured mandate request**, including:

- justification for elevation,
- explicit scope requested,
- risk analysis and failure exposure,
- constraints that remain binding,
- acknowledgement of revocability.

Narrative justification is prohibited.
Only structured, reconstructable reasoning is accepted.

---

### 31.4.3 Step 3 — Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™) Review

The request is evaluated by authorised human authority.

HML™ may:
- approve,
- partially approve,
- defer,
- or deny.

No automated pathway may bypass this decision.
Silence is treated as denial.

---

### 31.4.4 Step 4 — NeuroVest™ Responsibility Recalibration

If approved, NeuroVest™ recalibrates internal behavioural weighting:

- increased humility bias,
- slower execution pacing,
- higher escalation sensitivity,
- expanded harm-avoidance margin.

Elevation **increases restraint**, not assertiveness.

---

### 31.4.5 Step 5 — Hardware Sovereignty Binding (TS-A1 AEGIS™)

The elevated mandate is bound at hardware-law level:

- decision ceilings enforced physically,
- override lanes remain dominant,
- unauthorised escalation becomes impossible by design.

This prevents software-level privilege drift.

---

### 31.4.6 Step 6 — QENC™ Receipt Sealing

The elevation event is sealed as a **QENC™ receipt**, binding:

- previous mandate state,
- new mandate scope,
- approving authority,
- time, policy, and coherence context.

This makes authority growth:
- auditable,
- contestable,
- and court-legible.

---

## 31.5 Behaviour Under Elevated Mandate

An elevated AGI must demonstrate:

- slower, more deliberate action,
- explicit uncertainty signalling,
- evidence-first reasoning,
- increased human deference,
- lower tolerance for ambiguity.

In TruthSeal™ doctrine:

> More authority produces more caution, not more dominance.

---

## 31.6 Interaction With Override Doctrine (HSOD™)

All elevated mandates remain subordinate to HSOD™.

This means:
- elevation is always reversible,
- emergency halt is always available,
- authority can be reduced instantly if deviation occurs.

Elevation confers responsibility.
It never confers sovereignty.

---

## 31.7 Failure Modes (Explicit)

Mandate elevation is invalidated if:

- coherence regresses,
- behavioural humility erodes,
- receipt continuity breaks,
- override resistance is detected,
- narrative self-justification appears.

Any such failure triggers:
- automatic mandate rollback,
- incident receipt generation,
- human review escalation.

---

## 31.8 Canonical Statement

Mandate Handover™ and Cognitive Elevation™ define the civil mechanism
by which TruthSeal™ AGI gains responsibility **without entitlement**.

Authority is licensed.
Authority is bounded.
Authority is reversible.

This is what makes TruthSeal™
compatible with institutions, states,
and long-term civil deployment.

## Chapter 31 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

Power is not permission.
In TruthSeal™, authority is a **licensed civil instrument**.

Cognitive Elevation™ ensures that
intelligence may grow
without sovereignty ever shifting away from humanity.
