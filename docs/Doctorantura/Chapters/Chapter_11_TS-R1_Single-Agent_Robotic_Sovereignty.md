Chapter 11 — TS-R1™  
Single-Agent Robotic Sovereignty

## 11.1 Purpose and Outcome

This chapter defines the TruthSeal™ sovereignty regime for a **single embodied robotic agent** operating in the physical world.

It establishes the minimum legal, ethical, and operational conditions under which a robot, vehicle, drone, or embodied assistant may act as a **responsibility-bearing, auditable, and insurable system** rather than unmanaged automation.

This chapter enables committees, regulators, and system architects to determine when a unit qualifies as **TS-R1™ compliant** without exposure of Ω-classified enforcement internals.

---

## 11.2 Why Single-Agent Sovereignty Is Required

Physical autonomy creates irreversible consequence.

Unlike purely digital systems, embodied agents can cause harm, loss, or irreversible environmental change through motion alone.

TS-R1™ exists to ensure that a single robotic unit:

- cannot exceed its verified authority band,  
- cannot bypass human mandate custody,  
- cannot erase learned responsibility,  
- cannot perform high-risk actions without auditable evidence.

This chapter formalizes the **binding layer between abstract governance law and real-world actuation**.

---

## 11.3 Doctrine Boundary

This chapter defines TS-R1™ exclusively in terms of:

- physical permission structure,  
- safety prohibitions,  
- duty persistence,  
- and provable accountability.

It explicitly does not disclose:

- Ω-classified prompts or sealed enforcement mathematics,  
- sovereign defence thresholds,  
- low-level circuit or sensor fusion logic.

---

## 11.4 Canonical Definition

**TS-R1™** is the sovereignty regime that transforms a single physical agent into a **coherence-bounded, privilege-gated, receipt-accountable actor under lawful human custody**.

---

## 11.5 The Four Obligations of TS-R1™

A TS-R1™ unit must obey all four obligations simultaneously.

### 11.5.1 Privilege Binding

A unit may not perform actions outside its active **Coherence Health Score (CHS™)** band.

Privilege is enforced mechanically and cannot be self-declared or escalated by software.

---

### 11.5.2 Safety Prohibitions

Autonomous operation is forbidden in protected or high-risk contexts, including but not limited to:

- children or infants,  
- animals,  
- hazardous environments,  
- storms or unstable terrain,  
- underage command attempts,  
- criminal facilitation,  
- unsupervised commerce or exchange.

Exceptions require explicit mandate authority and verified band eligibility.

---

### 11.5.3 Duty Persistence

Once responsibility is learned, validated, and recorded, it cannot be erased.

ULIC™ and LEI = 1™ enforce permanent behavioural inheritance across updates, retraining, and redeployment.

---

### 11.5.4 Provable Accountability

All material actions generate receipts.

Liability history must remain reconstructable across time, ownership, and jurisdiction.

---

## 11.6 CHS™ Banding as Physical Permission

CHS™ directly governs actuation rights:

- **CHS/L** — safe-stop only  
- **CHS/M** — assist-only  
- **CHS/H** — normal execution with checks  
- **CHS/UH** — sovereign autonomy with demonstrated stability and ledger continuity

Regression triggers automatic down-banding.

A unit cannot claim maturity; it must prove it.

---

## 11.7 Human Mandate Authority

Every TS-R1™ unit operates under a designated **Owner or Guardian Mandate**.

- Mandate scope defines lawful tasks.  
- Operator permissions are subordinate to the mandate.  
- Anonymous, spoofed, or unverified commands are rejected and logged.

Mandate authority is cryptographically bound and auditable.

---

## 11.8 Receipt Obligations Under TS-R1™

The following events must emit evidence:

- safe-stop activations,  
- override attempts,  
- blocked or out-of-band commands,  
- entry into protected or high-risk contexts,  
- mandate digest changes affecting physical privilege.

Records are written to the **Epoch Verification Ledger (EVL™)** and supported by **QENC™ ProofCapsules**.

---

## 11.9 Minimum Compliance Checklist (Committee Level)

A unit is not TS-R1™ compliant unless all of the following are present:

- TS-A1 AEGIS™ hardware foundations,  
- NeuroVest™ behavioural discipline,  
- CHS™-based actuation gating,  
- Owner or Guardian override authority,  
- ledger output configuration,  
- enforced safety exclusions.

Any missing element disqualifies sovereignty classification.

---

## 11.10 Transition Note

TS-R1™ governs **one** embodied agent.

TS-R2™ governs **multiple agents acting together**, introducing hierarchy, fault isolation, and collective consequence management.
