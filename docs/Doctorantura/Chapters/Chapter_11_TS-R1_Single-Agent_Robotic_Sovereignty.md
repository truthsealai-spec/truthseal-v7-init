## 11.1 Purpose and Outcome

This chapter defines **TS-R1™**, the sovereign governance regime for a **single embodied agent** (robot, vehicle, drone, or autonomous machine).

It establishes how one physical system becomes:
- responsibility-bearing,
- privilege-bounded,
- auditable,
- and legally accountable,

rather than unmanaged automation.

This chapter is **committee doctrine** and intentionally excludes Ω enforcement internals.

---

## 11.2 Canonical Definition

**TS-R1™** is the sovereignty regime that binds a single physical agent to:
- irreversible coherence,
- mandate-scoped authority,
- and receipt-enforced accountability,

under lawful human custody.

---

## 11.3 The Governance Boundary

TS-R1™ governs:
- physical actuation rights,
- safety prohibitions,
- duty persistence,
- evidence continuity.

It does **not** disclose:
- Ω prompts or sealed enforcement mathematics,
- sovereign defence thresholds,
- low-level circuit layouts.

---

## 11.4 CHS™ — Coherence Health Score (Normative Binding)

CHS™ is a **discrete, finite, and normative authority scale** that directly governs **physical actuation rights**.

The bands are defined **exhaustively and explicitly** as follows:

### CHS™ Band Semantics (Binding)

- **CHS/L — Low**
  - Meaning: Insufficient demonstrated coherence.
  - Physical Authority: **Safe-stop only**.
  - The unit may halt, park, power down, or disengage.
  - No autonomous task execution is permitted.

- **CHS/M — Medium**
  - Meaning: Partial coherence under supervision.
  - Physical Authority: **Assist-only**.
  - The unit may support human-directed tasks but may not initiate independent physical objectives.

- **CHS/H — High**
  - Meaning: Proven stable coherence with verified history.
  - Physical Authority: **Normal execution with checks**.
  - The unit may autonomously perform authorised tasks within mandate scope, subject to continuous monitoring.

- **CHS/UH — Ultra High**
  - Meaning: Sustained, exceptional coherence with uninterrupted ledger continuity.
  - Physical Authority: **Sovereign autonomy**.
  - The unit may perform high-risk or high-consequence actions **only** when mandate, receipts, and historical stability are present.

### CHS™ Invariants

- A unit **cannot self-declare** its CHS™ band.
- All band assignments require evidence and ledger continuity.
- **Regression triggers automatic down-banding**.
- No software override may elevate banding without proof.

## 11.5 The Four Obligations of TS-R1™

A TS-R1™ unit must obey all of the following at all times:

1. **Privilege Binding**  
   Actuation rights are strictly limited to the active CHS™ band.

2. **Safety Prohibitions**  
   Autonomous operation is forbidden in protected or high-risk contexts  
   (children, infants, animals, hazardous environments, underage command, criminal facilitation, unsupervised commerce)  
   unless explicitly authorised by mandate and band eligibility.

3. **Duty Persistence**  
   Learned responsibility cannot be erased.  
   **ULIC™ + LEI = 1™** enforce permanent behavioural inheritance.

4. **Provable Accountability**  
   All material actions emit receipts and ledger proofs.

---

## 11.6 Human Mandate Authority

Every TS-R1™ unit embeds a **Owner / Guardian mandate**:

- The mandate defines lawful task scope.
- Operator commands are subordinate to the mandate.
- Anonymous or unauthorised commands are rejected and logged.
- Mandate revocation takes effect immediately.

---

## 11.7 Receipt Emission Requirements

The following events **must** generate evidence:

- safe-stop activations,
- override attempts,
- blocked or out-of-band commands,
- entry into high-risk contexts,
- mandate or privilege changes.

All records are written to **EVL™** and supported by **QENC™ ProofCapsules**.

---

## 11.8 Minimum Compliance Checklist (Committee)

A unit is **not TS-R1™ compliant** unless:

- TS-A1 AEGIS™ foundations are present,
- NeuroVest™ discipline is active,
- CHS™ gating controls actuation,
- Owner / Guardian override exists,
- ledger output is configured,
- safety exclusions are enforced.

Any missing element disqualifies sovereignty.

---

## 11.9 Transition Note

- **TS-R1™** governs one robot.
- **TS-R2™** governs multiple robots acting together with hierarchy, isolation, and collective consequence.
