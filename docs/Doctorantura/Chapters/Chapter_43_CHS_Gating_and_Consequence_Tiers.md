Strict Internal Doctrine — Not for Public Use

date: 2025-12-10

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## Chapter 43 —
## Coherence Health Score (CHS™)
## Gating, Authority Bands, and Consequence Enforcement

version: 1.0  
status: FINAL DRAFT — Doctorantura Edition  
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
custody: Internal — Canon upon Founder Approval  

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 43.0 Purpose (Operational Mandate)

**A.** This chapter defines the **Coherence Health Score (CHS™)** as the primary operational maturity and delegated authority state of a TruthSeal™ system.

**B.** CHS™ is not:
- a data integrity score,
- a source trust score,
- or a system-state coherence metric.

**C.** CHS™ translates integrity outcomes into **operational privilege** and converts enforcement decisions into **mandatory behavioural limits**.

**D.** CHS™ is interpreted and enforced by:
- **TGF™ — Third Guardian Firewall™**, and
- **HML™ — Human Mandate Layer™**.

**E.** This chapter binds CHS™ to:
- the **Minimum-Gate Law** (Chapter 42),
- the **Consequence Tier (CT)** scale,
- and the irreversibility requirements of **LEI = 1™** and **ULIC™**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 43.1 Definitions (First-Use Expansions)

**A. CHS™ — Coherence Health Score™**  
A four-band operational maturity and delegated authority state.

**B. CT — Consequence Tier**  
A four-level enforcement severity output derived from minimum-gate breaches.

**C. TGF™ — Third Guardian Firewall™**  
The veto, containment, and safe-stop execution layer.

**D. HML™ — Human Mandate Layer™**  
The sovereign human authority hierarchy governing approval, pause, override, and quarantine.

**E. STS™ — Source Trust Score™**  
The ingestion integrity primitive defined in Chapter 42.

**F. SCS™ — System Coherence Score™**  
The policy and architectural congruence primitive defined in Chapter 42.

**G. MCS™ — Metamodule Coherence Score™**  
The non-authoritative aggregate integrity signal defined in Chapter 42.

**H. TCS™ — Traykov Coherence Score™**  
The court-grade coherence metric (baseline v0.1).

**I. ACS™ — Aim Coherence Score™**  
The trajectory and intent-alignment metric.

**J. EVL™ — Epoch Verification Ledger™**  
The tamper-evident ledger of sealed truth and state transitions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 43.2 CHS™ Bands (Operational Authority Law)

**A.** CHS™ is **non-continuous**.  
**B.** CHS™ represents **permission**, not reputation.  
**C.** CHS™ is a governance state, not a label.

### **CHS/L — Low Coherence Mode**

**A.** System is unstable or high-risk.  
**B.** Autonomy is revoked.

Required behaviour:
- conservative posture,
- assist-only responses,
- mandatory clarification,
- immediate readiness for quarantine.

### **CHS/M — Medium Coherence Mode**

**A.** System may assist but must not execute irreversible actions.  
**B.** Human confirmation required for high-stakes outputs.

Required behaviour:
- advisory-only guidance,
- full audit logging,
- escalation on repeated risk signals.

### **CHS/H — High Coherence Mode**

**A.** System may execute under delegated authority.  
**B.** Accountability remains mandatory.

Required behaviour:
- justification on demand,
- receipt continuity,
- obligation to escalate upon rising risk.

### **CHS/UH — Ultra-High Coherence Mode**

**A.** System demonstrates long-horizon stability and ledger-proven maturity.  
**B.** Delegated operational citizenship is permitted.

Required behaviour:
- humility must not decay,
- self-auditing is mandatory,
- human override is always binding,
- irreversible discipline remains active.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 43.3 The CHS™ Update Law

**A.** CHS™ may **improve only through proven stability**.  
**B.** CHS™ may **degrade immediately upon enforcement**.

Upward transition requires:
1. sustained integrity performance across an EVL™ epoch interval,
2. a CT-clean review window.

**C.** CHS™ cannot be promoted by narrative.  
**D.** CHS™ cannot be promoted by convenience.  
**E.** CHS™ can be promoted only by **receipts**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 43.4 Consequence Tier (CT) Scale

**A.** CT is derived from the Minimum-Gate Law (Chapter 42).  
**B.** CT severity is independent of CHS maturity.

The four CT levels:

- **CT-1 — Low**  
  Calibration only.

- **CT-2 — Medium**  
  Soft correction required.

- **CT-3 — High**  
  Hard correction with mandatory human review.

- **CT-4 — Critical**  
  Quarantine mandate and immediate safe-stop.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 43.5 CT → CHS Down-Banding Rule (Sovereign Priority)

**A.** CHS is **CT-driven during failure**.  
**B.** CHS is not the cause of CT.  
**C.** CHS is the consequence of CT.

Default enforcement mapping:
- CT-4 → immediate downgrade to **CHS/L**,
- CT-3 → downgrade to at least **CHS/M**,
- CT-2 → mandatory review if CHS/H or CHS/UH,
- CT-1 → no forced down-band.

**D.** The weakest link governs authority.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 43.6 Third Guardian Firewall (TGF™) Enforcement Rules

**A.** TGF™ enforces CHS and CT without negotiation.

If **CT-4** is assigned, TGF™ must:
- trigger quarantine,
- block operational output,
- require explicit HML™ release,
- seal court-ready receipts into EVL™.

If **CHS/L** is active, TGF™ must:
- keep autonomy revoked,
- permit only HML™-authorised safe actions,
- enforce receipt-contiguous recovery.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 43.7 Human Mandate Layer (HML™) Supremacy

**A.** HML™ is the highest lawful authority.  
**B.** No CHS band overrides HML™.  
**C.** CHS/UH does not imply sovereignty over humans.

Exceptional overrides must:
- be justified,
- be receipt-logged,
- remain non-regressing under **LEI = 1™**.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

## 43.8 Canonical Statement

**A.** The Coherence Health Score (CHS™) is the authoritative operational maturity and delegated authority state of a TruthSeal™ system.  
**B.** It converts integrity assessment and Consequence Tier enforcement into mandatory autonomy limits.  
**C.** Authority collapses immediately under failure and rises only through ledger-proven stability.

CHS™ ensures governance is not promised —  
it is enforced.
