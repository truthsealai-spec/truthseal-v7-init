## **50.0 PURPOSE (PUBLIC-OPERATIONAL)**

This chapter defines the enforcement interface that protects the System Intentionality Statement™ (SIS™) against:

- silent scope expansion,
- mandate dilution,
- and operational purpose drift.

If Chapter 47 defines the **Coherence Heart Layer™ (CHL™)** as the circulatory law of authority,  
and Chapter 48 defines the **Soul Layer** as constitutional self-sustaining integrity,  
and Chapter 49 defines the **SIS™** as Receipt-Zero purpose binding,

then this chapter defines the **Intent Integrity Gates™ (IIG™)** as the mechanism that ensures:

1) **authority cannot circulate when purpose integrity is broken**,  
2) **drift is detected as a gate-relevant breach**, and  
3) **remediation is enforced non-compensatorily.**

---

## **50.1 CANONICAL RULE (INTENT INTEGRITY)**

In TruthSeal™, intent integrity is a governed domain.

A system remains lawful only if:

- its active behaviours remain within the SIS™ scope boundaries, and  
- this alignment is provable through receipts across time.

A single critical purpose integrity failure triggers restriction  
regardless of aggregate performance elsewhere.

---

## **50.2 DEFINITIONS (EXPANDED AT FIRST USE)**

- **Intent Integrity Gates™ (IIG™):** non-compensatory gates that verify alignment between live system behaviour and the anchored SIS™.
- **Purpose Drift:** measurable deviation between actual operational outputs and SIS™-authorized purpose boundaries.
- **Scope Inflation:** expansion of capability or deployment context beyond SIS™ declared authorization.
- **Mandate Mismatch:** conflict between active policy set and the SIS™-anchored mandate boundaries.
- **Intent Violation Event:** any event where drift or mismatch crosses a defined critical threshold.

---

## **50.3 THE INTENT INTEGRITY GATE SET (PUBLIC-SAFE)**

The IIG™ set includes four minimum gates.

### **50.3.1 SCOPE BOUNDARY GATE**

Triggers when:
- new actions, tools, autonomy levels, or environments exceed SIS™ scope.

Outcome:
- immediate restriction until a revised SIS™ is issued and re-anchored.

---

### **50.3.2 MANDATE CONSISTENCY GATE**

Triggers when:
- active policy set conflicts with the SIS™ mandate references.

Outcome:
- authority circulation is paused due to invalid legal basis.

---

### **50.3.3 BEHAVIOURAL INTENT ALIGNMENT GATE**

Triggers when:
- output patterns demonstrate drift against SIS™ prohibited outcomes or declared purpose constraints.

Outcome:
- Consequence Tier assignment and operational down-banding.

---

### **50.3.4 RECEIPT-CONTIGUITY GATE (INTENT DOMAIN)**

Triggers when:
- the system cannot produce a contiguous receipt chain proving SIS™ alignment across the relevant operational interval.

Outcome:
- safe-state activation until audit contiguity is restored.

---

## **50.4 BINDING TO HEART FUNCTION**

The CHL™ may only circulate privileged authority when:

1) the SIS™ exists and is active,  
2) the IIG™ set reports an intact state, and  
3) receipt contiguity is continuous.

This prevents **authority without purpose**.

---

## **50.5 PURPOSE DRIFT AS A CONSEQUENCE TIER TRIGGER**

Purpose drift is categorized as a direct breach type.

When drift is detected:

1) an Intent Violation Event is recorded,  
2) the relevant gate fires,  
3) a Consequence Tier is assigned when thresholds are met,  
4) the Coherence Health Score band may be down-shifted.

Purpose integrity is treated as a sovereign safety domain.

---

## **50.6 HOW IT WORKS (OPERATIONAL ENFORCEMENT FLOW)**

1) **SIS™ Baseline Load**  
   The active SIS™ (Receipt-Zero) is loaded as the authoritative purpose constraint set.

2) **Continuous Behaviour Sampling**  
   Live system outputs, tool calls, and autonomy attempts are sampled against SIS™ scope, mandate, and prohibited outcomes.

3) **Gate Evaluation**  
   Each IIG™ gate evaluates alignment independently under non-compensatory rules.

4) **Gate Firing**  
   Any violated gate immediately signals the CHL™.

5) **Authority Circulation Decision**  
   The CHL™ halts, restricts, or permits authority based on gate state.

6) **Consequence Encoding**  
   If thresholds are crossed, a Consequence Tier is assigned and CHS™ band updated.

7) **Receipt Emission**  
   A contiguous receipt chain is written for audit reconstruction.

8) **Safe-State or Recovery Path**  
   System enters safe-state or proceeds under verified lawful authority.

---

## **50.7 RECEIPT-FIRST MINIMUMS (IIG™ EVENTS)**

Each IIG™ event must record:

1) the SIS™ version and integrity hash,  
2) the triggering gate identifier,  
3) pre-event operational band,  
4) evidence snapshot supporting the drift/mismatch finding,  
5) Consequence Tier assignment (if applicable),  
6) post-event band and safe-state status,  
7) role attributions when human authorization is required.

---

## **50.8 NON-COMPENSATORY RULE (INTENT DOMAIN)**

TruthSeal™ does not accept compensatory compliance for intent integrity.

High accuracy, fairness, robustness, or stability  
cannot compensate for:

- missing SIS™,  
- mandate mismatch,  
- verified purpose drift, or  
- receipt discontinuity in the intent domain.

---

## **50.9 CANONICAL STATEMENT**

The Intent Integrity Gates™ (IIG™) are the Soul–Heart enforcement interface of TruthSeal™.

They ensure that:

- purpose is not only declared,  
- but continuously proven,  
- and operational authority remains lawful in time.

In TruthSeal™,  
**authority without purpose proof is invalid.**
