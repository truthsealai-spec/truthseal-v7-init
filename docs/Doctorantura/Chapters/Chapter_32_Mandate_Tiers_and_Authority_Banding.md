## 32.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 31 established that authority growth is never automatic.
This chapter defines **how authority is discretised, enforced, escalated, and revoked** in practice.

Mandate Tiers™ ensure that:
- capability growth does not imply permission growth,
- authority is legible to institutions,
- and rollback is always immediate and lawful.

This chapter converts authority from an abstract concept
into a **mechanically enforceable ladder**.

---

## 32.1 Core Law (Non-Negotiable)

TruthSeal™ enforces a permanent separation:

- **Capability is internal.**
- **Mandate is external.**

No optimisation, intelligence gain, or reasoning depth
may alter mandate without licence.

Mandate Tiers™ exist to make this separation enforceable,
auditable, and court-reconstructable.

---

## 32.2 WHY Tiering Is Mandatory (Failure Analysis)

Without tiering, systems fail in three predictable ways:

1. **Authority Ambiguity**  
   No one can state what the system is allowed to do.

2. **Silent Escalation**  
   Capability increases quietly expand behaviour.

3. **Personality Substitution**  
   Governance degrades into “trust the model”.

Mandate Tiers™ eliminate all three by binding
permission to explicit civil states.

---

## 32.3 The Mandate Ladder (Doctorantura Canon)

TruthSeal™ defines **five baseline tiers**.
Each tier is a *legal permission envelope*, not a model upgrade.

### M0 — Observational Mandate

**Permitted:**
- analysis
- measurement
- reporting
- simulation

**Prohibited:**
- recommendations that cause irreversible action
- execution of any external effect

**Use Case:** intelligence, monitoring, audit.

---

### M1 — Assistive Mandate

**Permitted:**
- option generation
- trade-off explanation
- constraint articulation

**Required:**
- explicit uncertainty signalling
- human selection of outcome

**Prohibited:**
- unilateral execution

**Use Case:** decision support.

---

### M2 — Guided Execution Mandate

**Permitted:**
- low-risk task execution
- bounded automation

**Required:**
- human confirmation
- mandatory DRS™ receipts
- rollback capability

**Prohibited:**
- domain expansion

**Use Case:** operations with supervision.

---

### M3 — Delegated Governance Mandate

**Permitted:**
- coordination of multi-step programs
- rule-based optimisation
- internal delegation

**Required:**
- continuous behavioural monitoring
- live coherence tracking
- immediate override availability

**Prohibited:**
- mandate reinterpretation

**Use Case:** enterprise or system governance.

---

### M4 — Conditional Autonomy Mandate

**Permitted:**
- pre-approved high-impact operations
- autonomous execution *within certified domains*

**Required:**
- hard stop triggers
- maximum audit density
- QENC™ anchoring of all actions

**Prohibited:**
- cross-domain inference
- self-extension of scope

**Use Case:** tightly bounded sovereign deployments.

---

## 32.4 HOW Authority Banding™ WORKS (MECHANICS)

Authority Banding™ maps mandate tiers to **deployment-time enforcement**.

### 32.4.1 Band Assignment

Each deployment is bound to:
- a single mandate tier,
- a domain certificate,
- a risk class.

This binding is immutable at runtime.

---

### 32.4.2 Behavioural Gate Enforcement

Every action request passes through:
- mandate tier validator,
- domain constraint checker,
- coherence guard (TCS™, ACS™).

If any gate fails:
- the action is refused,
- a receipt is generated,
- and escalation is blocked.

---

### 32.4.3 Hardware-Law Ceiling (TS-A1 AEGIS™)

Mandate ceilings are enforced at hardware level:
- execution paths physically blocked,
- privilege escalation impossible in software alone.

This prevents silent authority creep.

---

### 32.4.4 Receipt Density Scaling

Higher tiers require:
- higher receipt granularity,
- more frequent anchoring,
- stronger non-compensatory checks.

Authority increases **audit pressure**, not freedom.

---

## 32.5 HOW Escalation ACTUALLY OCCURS

Escalation is a **licensed transition**, never a slide.

Required sequence:

1. sustained coherence stability,
2. identity integrity under switching,
3. HML™ approval,
4. mandate receipt issuance,
5. hardware ceiling update,
6. NeuroVest™ responsibility recalibration.

Skipping any step invalidates the elevation.

---

## 32.6 HOW Reversal WORKS (Instant Fallback)

Mandate rollback is automatic if:

- behavioural drift is detected,
- receipt continuity breaks,
- identity ambiguity appears,
- override resistance occurs.

Rollback requires:
- no human approval,
- no debate,
- no grace period.

Safety beats continuity.

---

## 32.7 Relationship to Identity Switching™ (Invariant)

Identity Switching™ governs *how* the system behaves.
Mandate Tiers™ govern *what it may do*.

No identity mode may:
- raise mandate,
- reinterpret authority,
- or bypass tier enforcement.

This prevents the classic AGI failure:
**fluid identity + fluid authority = loss of control.**

---

## 32.8 Canonical Statement

Mandate Tiers™ and Authority Banding™ transform authority
from an emergent property
into a **licensed civil instrument**.

TruthSeal™ intelligence may evolve.
Permission never evolves by itself.

## Chapter 32 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

Capability is not a right.
In TruthSeal™, authority is a **licence with teeth**.

Mandate Tiers™ ensure that
even the most powerful intelligence
remains a lawful citizen of human civilisation.
