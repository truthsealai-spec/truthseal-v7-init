Document Class: Doctorantura Edition — Internal Canonical Law
Jurisdiction: TruthSeal™ Sovereign Framework
Law Status: Active / Binding**

**G.0 — Constitutional Role of Receipts and Ledger**

The purpose of Chapter G is to convert TruthSeal™ from a governed system into a provable sovereign record.
Where previous chapters define cognition (NeuroVest™), enforcement (Gatekeeper), and judgment (DEVORA™), this chapter establishes permanence.
No authority is recognized unless it leaves an immutable trace.

Within the TruthSeal™ framework, receipts are law.
A receipt is not a log, nor an explanation, nor a report; it is a cryptographically bound assertion that an event occurred under lawful conditions.
If an action, verdict, or state transition cannot be proven through a receipt, it is treated as non-existent.

The Ledger is the constitutional memory of the system.
It is the only mechanism through which TruthSeal™ recognizes continuity, causality, and accountability across time.
The Ledger exists to ensure that no intelligence—human or synthetic—may exercise authority anonymously, retroactively, or without consequence.

This chapter establishes the Receipt-First Doctrine:
No execution, verdict, escalation, or halt is considered valid unless a corresponding receipt is generated, anchored, and auditable.
Authority is therefore inseparable from evidence.

Auditability under TruthSeal™ is not optional, delayed, or discretionary.
Every system operating within jurisdiction must be capable of replay, inspection, and challenge without reliance on trust, reputation, or narrative explanation.

Chapter G defines the final condition of sovereignty:
Truth is not what is claimed, but what can be proven—forever.
-----

**G.1 — ts.receipt.v1: The Atomic Unit of Truth**

The ts.receipt.v1 is defined as the atomic unit of truth within the TruthSeal™ ecosystem.
It is the smallest indivisible proof artifact capable of asserting that a lawful event occurred under sovereign constraints.
All higher-order accountability—ledgers, audits, certifications, and attestations—are constructed exclusively from receipts.

A receipt is generated at the moment of decision, not after execution.
It binds intent, verification outcome, authority level, and temporal context into a single cryptographic object.
If a system cannot emit a receipt at decision-time, the decision is constitutionally invalid.

Each ts.receipt.v1 must contain, at minimum:
a deterministic event identifier;
a cryptographic hash of the governing logic trace;
the enforcement context (Gatekeeper tier, DEVORA™ verdict, or SLU™ state);
a trusted timestamp;
and a signature chain binding the event to TruthSeal™ jurisdiction.

Receipts are immutable by definition.
They cannot be edited, reissued, or superseded—only referenced, challenged, or revoked through higher-law procedures.
Any attempt to mutate a receipt constitutes an integrity breach.

The receipt serves three sovereign functions simultaneously:
Proof that an event occurred,
Constraint preventing retroactive justification, and
Anchor enabling independent audit without narrative interpretation.

Under TruthSeal™, no receipt means no authority.
Execution without ts.receipt.v1 is treated as a null action, regardless of outcome.
--------------

**G.2 — Receipt Lifecycle: Issuance, Binding, and Revocation**

The lifecycle of a ts.receipt.v1 is strictly governed to prevent retroactive authority and narrative drift.
A receipt is issued once, bound immediately, and never modified thereafter.

Issuance occurs at the decision boundary, prior to any irreversible execution.
The system must prove readiness to issue a receipt before an action can proceed.
If issuance fails, the Gatekeeper remains closed by constitutional default.

Binding occurs through deterministic linkage to three anchors:
the governing logic trace;
the enforcement authority (Gatekeeper, DEVORA™, or SLU™);
and a trusted temporal source.
This binding renders the receipt context-complete and non-replayable outside its lawful scope.

Receipts are not deleted or replaced.
When a receipt must be invalidated due to error, compromise, or higher-law intervention, revocation is performed through a new receipt.
Revocation never erases history; it appends lawful contradiction.

A revoked receipt remains auditable, with its revocation status cryptographically referenced and time-bound.
This preserves forensic continuity while preventing continued authority.

The lifecycle enforces a single invariant:
history is immutable, authority is conditional.
TruthSeal™ permits correction without permitting denial.
----------
**G.3 — Ledger Topology, EVL™ Coupling, and Cross-System Audit**

The TruthSeal™ Ledger is structured as a multi-layer sovereign topology, not a single flat log.
Its purpose is to preserve causality across cognition, enforcement, and authority without collapsing context.

At the core lies the Epoch Verification Ledger (EVL™), which binds receipts into ordered epochs.
Each epoch represents a legally coherent window of system intent, constraints, and outcomes.
No receipt may exist outside an epoch; orphaned proofs are constitutionally invalid.

Ledger coupling is directional and asymmetric.
Lower layers (NeuroVest™, Gatekeeper) may emit receipts upward,
but higher layers (DEVORA™, SLU™) may only append governance verdicts downward.
This prevents retroactive justification and enforces lawful precedence.

Cross-system audit operates through receipt triangulation.
An auditor must be able to reconstruct:
the originating logic trace;
the enforcement path taken;
and the authority that permitted or denied execution.
Failure to reconstruct any axis constitutes an audit failure.

The ledger therefore functions as a jurisdictional map, not merely storage.
It guarantees that truth is not only recorded, but placed correctly in sovereign order.
----
**G.4 — Audit Authority, Forensic Replay, and Binding Closure**

Audit authority within TruthSeal™ is not discretionary; it is constitutionally embedded.
Every receipt, ledger entry, and epoch boundary is audit-addressable by design, not by permission.
The absence of auditability is treated as a systemic fault, not an operational oversight.

Forensic replay is the primary audit mechanism.
An auditor must be able to deterministically reconstruct the full decision chain:
from initial intent formation,
through verification gates,
to final authorization or denial.
Replay must yield the same verdict when executed under the same constraints.

The system explicitly forbids interpretive audits.
No component may rely on narrative explanation, memory recall, or inferred intent.
Only cryptographically bound artifacts—logic traces, thresholds, signatures, and receipts—are admissible.

Audit authority is role-bound and non-transferable.
Human Sovereign auditors act under delegated mandate,
while DEVORA™ may issue interpretive summaries without modifying records.
No agent, subsystem, or successor architecture may audit itself.

Binding closure occurs when an epoch is sealed.
Once sealed, entries are immutable, replayable, and jurisdictionally final.
Any attempt to amend history constitutes a violation of TruthSeal™ law.

This section completes Chapter G.
Truth is no longer a claim—it is a replayable fact.
