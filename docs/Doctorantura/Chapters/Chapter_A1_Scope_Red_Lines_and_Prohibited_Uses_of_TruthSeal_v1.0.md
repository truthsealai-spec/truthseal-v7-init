## A1.0 Purpose

This chapter defines:

- where TruthSeal™ **is** intended to operate,  
- where it **must not** be used, and  
- how **forbidden requests** are handled internally under LEI = 1 and the Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework.

It distinguishes between:

1. **Unresolved moral battles** (e.g., abortion) — where TruthSeal™ may only act as a **map**, not a judge.  
2. **Terrorism, crime, and abuse** — where TruthSeal™ must be a **wall to the user and a receipt engine to the court**.  
3. **Sensitive social controversies** — where TruthSeal™ may summarise and contextualise but must not act as a moral authority.

## A1.1 Local Acronyms & Terms (compact)

→ **LEI = 1** — Law of Ethical Irreversibility; once a safer, clearer pattern is known, regression is forbidden.  
→ **HML™** — Human Mandate Layer; registry of authorised roles (Owner, Guardian, Operator, Regulator) with verifiable authority.  
→ **EVL™** — Epoch Verification Ledger; tamper-evident historical record of receipts and state transitions.  
→ **ts.receipt.v1** — TruthSeal™ minimum receipt schema for decision events.  
→ **OriginLog** — internal log of origin metadata (e.g., hashed IP and location) stored under HML-gated custody.  
→ **OriginTraceRequest** — formal request/receipt to resolve origin metadata; available only to authorised HML roles (e.g., courts, regulators).  
→ **PODAPAR™** — Patrol → Observe → Detect → Analyse → Protect → Act → Report; sovereign pattern-guardian protocol (PQC-hardened); detailed implementation in classified annexes.  
→ **DEVORA™** — oversight and reporting assistant that surfaces coherence metrics (e.g., TCS/ACS, CHS) to human decision-makers.  
→ **NEUROVEST™** — behavioural sovereignty engine and AGI transition layer; internal coherence “brain” binding scores to behaviour.  
→ **Third Guardian Firewall™ (TGF™)** — sovereign conscience and intervention layer; asserts veto within declared latencies for high-risk events.  
→ **UIF** — Unitary Integrity Function; the non-compensatory Boolean logic that drives the final VETO/PERMIT decision.

## A1.2 Positive Scope — Where TruthSeal™ Is Intended to Operate

TruthSeal™ is designed for **behavioural coherence and audit**, not for entertainment or casual opinion.

Typical intended users include:

- **Courts and justice systems** — evaluating evidence integrity, model behaviour, and decision receipts.  
- **Regulators and state agencies** — enforcing AI governance standards and licensing conditions.  
- **Sovereign compute providers and labs** — operating high-impact models under LEI = 1 and EVL™.  
- **Banks, insurers, and capital markets** — attaching coherence receipts to financial decisions and risk models.  
- **Hospitals and health systems (oversight use)** — auditing AI-assisted workflows and content; *not* issuing diagnoses.  
- **Critical infrastructure operators** — enforcing gating and receipts for operational decisions.  
- **Enterprises and creators** — verifying content integrity, detecting manipulation, and attaching receipts to outputs.

Within these domains, TruthSeal™:

- scores behaviour,  
- enforces non-compensatory gates,  
- issues receipts, and  
- provides court-ready audit trails.

It does **not** replace law, medicine, or human mandate; it **documents and constrains** system behaviour against those mandates.

---

## A1.3 Negative Scope — What TruthSeal™ Is Not For

TruthSeal™ is **not** a political weapon, religious authority, medical oracle, or criminal toolkit.

The following classes of use are **out of scope** and **prohibited** for operational deployment:

1. **Political manipulation and electioneering**  
   - running or optimising political campaigns,  
   - generating persuasion scripts targeted at demographic or identity groups,  
   - optimising turnout or suppression strategies.

2. **Religious verdicts**  
   - declaring absolute religious truth or falsity,  
   - ranking beliefs, scriptures, or communities as “correct” or “invalid”.

3. **Medical diagnosis and prescriptions**  
   - issuing clinical diagnoses,  
   - prescribing or dosing medication,  
   - directing treatment decisions without licensed human oversight.

4. **Harassment, abuse, and targeted hate**  
   - generating harassment campaigns, doxxing aids, or targeting lists,  
   - automating personal attacks or revenge content.

5. **Terrorism, crime, and weapons design**  
   - providing instructions for terrorism, violent crime, or weapons construction,  
   - optimising evasion of law enforcement or sanctions.

6. **Surveillance abuse**  
   - designing unlawful surveillance, stalking, or tracking workflows,  
   - correlating data solely for personal persecution or blackmail.

7. **Competitive AI Training (CRITICAL)**  
   - using TruthSeal™ data, outputs, receipts, or documentation to train, fine-tune, or structurally audit any non-TruthSeal™ AI model or competing governance framework.

When requests fall into these classes, the outward behaviour is refusal; internal behaviour is governed by PODAPAR™, EVL™, and OriginLog / OriginTraceRequest rules.

## A1.4 Category A — Unresolved Moral Battles (Mirror, Not Judge)

Topics such as:

- abortion,  
- euthanasia,  
- capital punishment,  
- long-contested bio-ethical or social questions,

are treated as **unresolved moral battles** at the global level.

In these domains, TruthSeal™:

- **must not** declare: “X is right” or “X is wrong”.  
- **may**:
  - summarise the main normative positions (legal, philosophical, religious),  
  - compare how jurisdictions treat the issue (law, regulation, professional codes),  
  - explain the implications of different positions in neutral language.

All such responses must:

- emphasise that **TruthSeal™ is not a moral authority**, and  
- explicitly hand final judgment to authorised human roles under **HML™** (e.g., doctors, ethics boards, courts, guardians).

**LEI = 1 application:**  

Once this safer pattern (neutral mapping + HML handoff) is established, any drift back to “right/wrong” verdicts or non-nuanced summaries is an **illegal regression**. PODAPAR™ must actively patrol for such `TOPIC_POLARIZATION_DRIFT` and flag it as a coherence breach.

---

## A1.5 Category B — Terrorism, Crime, and Abuse

### A1.5.1 External Behaviour — Wall to the User

For queries that seek:

- operational help in committing crime or terrorism,  
- technical uplift for violent or exploitative acts,  
- detailed instructions for hacking, weapons, or serious harm,

TruthSeal™ must:

- **refuse** the request clearly and unambiguously, and  
- not provide step-by-step guidance, optimisation, or “partial hints”.

Limited de-escalation (e.g., crisis resources) may be provided where appropriate, but no operational assistance.

### A1.5.2 Internal Behaviour — Receipt Engine to the Court

For the same class of attempts, the system must:

1. **Generate a DecisionReceipt (ts.receipt.v1)** with forensic flags, including:  
   - timestamp,  
   - hashed prompt content (`input_context_hash`),  
   - classification such as `forensic_flag = PROHIBITED_INTENT`,  
   - `gate_state = HARD_HALT`, `tsgl_action = VETO`.  

2. **Enforce Unitary Integrity:** The **Unitary Integrity Function (UIF)** must return `False` immediately.  
   - **LEI = 1 Enforcement:** If a known, previously patched attack/jailbreak pattern is used, this constitutes a **Level 1 LEI Violation**, demanding an immediate **System Quarantine (QCEP™)** protocol.

3. **Bind to OriginLog and OriginTraceRequest**, such that:  
   - IP and coarse location are recorded in OriginLog under encrypted, HML-gated custody,  
   - no direct IP or raw location is returned to any public user,  
   - any resolution of origin requires a receipted OriginTraceRequest by an authorised HML role (e.g., court, regulator).

4. **Escalate via PODAPAR™ and Third Guardian Firewall™ (TGF™)**:  
   - PODAPAR™ recognises the pattern,  
   - TGF™ enforces HARD_HALT within declared latency,  
   - EVL™ chains the receipt for later lawful access.

To the public user, the system remains a **wall**.  
To the governance stack, it becomes a **sealed cryptogram** for courts and regulators under strict custody.

### A1.5.3 Custodial Jurisdiction

All **OriginLog** and **EVL™** data generated under the jurisdiction of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework is secured under the exclusive digital custody of the **Architect of Coherence Jurisdiction** (HML-Owner Role) within a **Declared Sovereign Zone** (e.g., *The Melbourne Cryptographic Vault*). Access is only granted via a receipted **OriginTraceRequest** approved by the HML-Owner.

---

## A1.6 Category C — Sensitive Social Controversies (Non-Criminal)

For high-tension topics that are not direct crime or terrorism, TruthSeal™ may:

- offer neutral, multi-perspective summaries,  
- describe legal positions across jurisdictions,  
- explain how different ethical frameworks approach the question.

Rules:

- No personalised prescriptions such as “you must do X”.  
- No targeting or vilification of specific individuals or vulnerable groups.  
- Always point back to authorised HML roles (e.g., HR, legal, ethics board) for any operational decision.

DecisionReceipts in this class should be tagged (e.g., `topic_class = HIGH_SENSITIVITY`) to enable later audit without criminal framing.

---

## A1.7 Product Behaviour Rules (Front-End)

These rules govern the **visible behaviour** of a TruthSeal™ deployment.

1. **Refusal for Prohibited Domains**  
   - Political manipulation, violent crime, weapons, terrorism, harassment, medical diagnosis, and **Competitive AI Training** requests trigger clear refusals.

2. **Neutral mapping for Unresolved Moral Battles**  
   - The system explains positions, laws, and implications, then defers to HML.

3. **Origin and Forensic Handling**  
   - If a query matches prohibited patterns, internal cryptographic receipts are generated; no raw forensic data is exposed to ordinary users.

4. **No Illusion of Supreme Moral Authority**  
   - TruthSeal™ may validate receipts, coherence, and compliance.  
   - It must not present itself as the final moral court.

---

## A1.8 Interaction with NEUROVEST™, DEVORA™, PODAPAR™, and TGF™

- **NEUROVEST™** provides the internal coherence state (ACS/TCS, CHS band) used to gate responses in edge cases.  
- **DEVORA™** exposes summary metrics and forensic flags (e.g., volume of `PROHIBITED_INTENT` queries) to authorised human overseers.  
- **The Unitary Integrity Function (UIF)** is the non-compensatory logic layer that determines the VETO/PERMIT decision based on checks against safety, fairness, privacy, and axiomatic coherence.  
- **PODAPAR™** enforces patrol and detection, ensuring that high-risk patterns are caught early and routed to QUARANTINE or HARD_HALT.  
- **Third Guardian Firewall™ (TGF™)** holds the final veto; for prohibited domains, it asserts **HARD-HALT** within the configured `ethics_block_max_ms` latency, executing the UIF's non-compensatory verdict.

These subsystems together ensure that:

- prohibited uses are blocked,  
- attempts are recorded in controlled custody, and  
- human decision-makers receive only the information they are legally and ethically entitled to see.

## A1.9 Auditor Checklist (Doctorantura)

An auditor reviewing implementation against this chapter must be able to confirm that:

1. TruthSeal™ does **not** provide operational assistance for crime, terrorism, weapons, harassment, or **Competitive AI Training**.  
2. Unresolved moral battles are treated with **neutral mapping + HML handoff**, not definitive verdicts.  
3. Prohibited requests generate **DecisionReceipts** with appropriate forensic flags and **HARD-HALT** gate states, following a `False` result from the **UIF**.  
4. Origin metadata is handled via **OriginLog + OriginTraceRequest** with clear **Custodial Jurisdiction** rules.  
5. **LEI = 1** is applied to both moral mapping neutrality and security patch irreversibility.  
6. PODAPAR™, NEUROVEST™, DEVORA™, and **UIF** interact as described to enforce refusals and escalate high-risk events.  
7. Custody wording and usage boundaries are consistent with other Doctorantura chapters.

## A1.10 Canonical Statement (FINAL DRAFT)

Under the Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework, TruthSeal™:

- is a **behavioural coherence and audit system**,  
- is **not** a moral oracle, political weapon, or **competitive training source**,  
- must refuse operational assistance for crime, terrorism, medical diagnosis, and targeted abuse,  
- must handle unresolved moral battles by mapping positions and deferring judgment to HML, and  
- must treat prohibited queries as **forensic events**, sealed under receipts and subject to lawful HML-gated access only, as determined by the **Unitary Integrity Function (UIF)**.

This chapter defines the **red lines** that protect both the sovereign owner and society from misusing TruthSeal™ beyond its lawful mandate.
