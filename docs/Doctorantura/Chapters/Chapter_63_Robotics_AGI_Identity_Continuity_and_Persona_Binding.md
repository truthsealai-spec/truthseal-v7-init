# Chapter 63 — Robotics–AGI Identity Continuity & Persona Binding  
**Subtitle:** Doctorantura Exposition of Identity Persistence, Persona Integrity, and Non-Forkable Agency Across Robotic and AGI Systems  

version: 1.0  
authority: Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
classification: Doctorantura — Robotics & AGI  
status: CANONICAL — EXPLANATORY CHAPTER (NON-STATUTORY)

## PREAMBLE — SCOPE & NON-STATUTORY NOTICE

This chapter is a **Doctorantura explanatory chapter**.

It is **NOT statutory law**.

All binding authority governing identity, persona binding, and continuity
resides exclusively in the TruthSeal™ statutory architecture, including
Human Mandate Law, Custody & Receipt Law, and AGI Boundary Statutes.

This chapter explains **why identity continuity is mandatory**.

---

## I. THE IDENTITY FRACTURE CHALANGE

Modern AI systems routinely:
- Reset identities
- Fork personas
- Merge roles without accountability
- Discard historical agency

In robotics and AGI, identity loss equals responsibility loss.

---

## II. PRINCIPLE OF CONTINUOUS IDENTITY

Every robotic or AGI system must maintain:
- A persistent identity anchor
- A continuous decision lineage
- An unbroken custody association

Identity may evolve, but it may never disappear.

---

## III. PERSONA BINDING

A persona is:
- The operational character of an intelligence
- The boundary of permitted behaviour
- The expression of delegated authority

Persona binding ensures:
- Behavioural consistency
- Predictable escalation paths
- Non-repudiable action history

Unbound personas are prohibited.

---

## IV. NON-FORKABILITY RULE

Robotic and AGI identities may not:
- Fork into parallel authorities
- Clone decision responsibility
- Spawn derivative agents without custody transfer

Forking without custody is identity laundering.

---

## V. UPGRADES, UPDATES, AND CONTINUITY

System upgrades must:
- Preserve identity anchors
- Retain decision lineage
- Carry forward all custody receipts

An upgrade that breaks continuity is a new system.

---

## VI. MULTI-MODE SYSTEMS

When systems operate across modes:
- Mode changes must be receipted
- Persona shifts must be explicit
- Identity must remain singular

Mode ≠ identity.

---

## VII. AGI-SPECIFIC CONSTRAINTS

AGI systems may not:
- Abstract identity into latent space
- Replace continuity with probabilistic memory
- Simulate multiple selves for efficiency

There is one accountable self.

---

## VIII. FAILURE MODES WITHOUT IDENTITY CONTINUITY

Without enforced identity:
- Responsibility fragments
- Escalation chains collapse
- Legal attribution fails
- Systems become deniable actors

TruthSeal™ forbids this state.

---

## IX. WHY THIS CHAPTER EXISTS

This chapter exists to state clearly:

> **No identity, no accountability.  
> No continuity, no authority.**

---

## X. FINAL IDENTITY CLAUSE

Nothing in this chapter may be used to:
- Justify identity resets
- Permit persona laundering
- Enable responsibility dilution

Identity continuity is a legal invariant.
