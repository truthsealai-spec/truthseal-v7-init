TRUTHSEAL™ DOCTORANTURA — THE SOVEREIGN ARC OF AGI FRAMEWORK v1.0
Strict Internal Doctrine — Not for Public Use

date: 8 December 2025

# Chapter 09 — ts.receipt.v1
## The Evidence Engine of Sovereign Trust

version: 1.0  
status: FINAL DRAFT — Doctorantura Edition — Internal Custody (Canon upon Founder Approval)  
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.), Founder & Chief Architect of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework

## 09.1 Purpose and Outcome

This chapter defines **ts.receipt.v1** as the canonical evidence primitive of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

It establishes the minimum committee-grade proof standard required to render high-stakes artificial general intelligence governance:

- court-admissible,
- institution-deployable,
- auditable without disclosure of Ω-classified enforcement internals.

This chapter converts governance from interpretation into **verifiable evidence continuity**.

---

## 09.2 Why Receipts Are Constitutionally Required

Advanced autonomy cannot be regulated, insured, licensed, or trusted at scale without standardized evidence.

ts.receipt.v1 exists to bind the full accountability chain:

human mandate  
→ admission  
→ execution  
→ evidence  
→ audit continuity

Without receipt continuity, no action qualifies as lawful, responsible, or sovereign under the TruthSeal™ framework.

---

## 09.3 Doctrinal Boundary

This chapter defines **committee-level operational doctrine** only.

It explicitly does NOT disclose:

- Ω-class internal prompts or enforcement logic,
- classified sovereign defense thresholds,
- internal mathematical gate functions.

Only the **stable, auditable evidence layer** and its mandatory links to public pillars are defined here.

---

## 09.4 Canonical Definitions

- **ts.receipt.v1**  
  The standardized evidence record for material actions governed under TruthSeal™.

- **Human Mandate Layer (HML™)**  
  The constitutional policy baseline defining lawful authority, scope, and risk permissions.

- **LEI = 1™ (Law of Ethical Irreversibility)**  
  Once higher responsibility is confirmed, regression is forbidden.

- **TruthSeal AEGIS™ (TS-A1)**  
  The hardware admission core enforcing mandate validation and non-regression prior to high-stakes execution.

- **Sovereign Arc**  
  The closed accountability loop returning responsibility to the human system parent through verifiable proof.

- **ACS™ (Aim Coherence Score)**  
  The fiduciary metric quantifying coherent directional intent under LEI = 1™.

---

## 09.5 Receipt Invariants (Non-Negotiable)

A valid ts.receipt.v1 MUST bind:

- identity of the responsible human system parent,
- the active HML™ mandate digest,
- declared risk class,
- admission decision and rationale,
- execution outcome,
- timestamps and integrity digests,
- anchoring state.

No high-stakes autonomy is compliant without unbroken receipt continuity.

---

## 09.6 Committee-Level Minimal Schema (Conceptual)

A ts.receipt.v1 record SHALL include, at minimum:

- receipt_id
- system_identity
- human_system_parent
- hml_digest
- action_intent_summary
- risk_class
- admission_result
- execution_result
- integrity_hashes
- anchor_status
- anchor_calendar_id (if applicable)
- anchor_tx (when confirmed)
- timestamp_utc

This chapter defines the **doctrinal minimum**.  
The full JSON schema is maintained separately in ledger standards.

---

## 09.7 UNKNOWN Rule (Outage Discipline)

If external anchoring services are unavailable:

- anchor_status MAY be set to **UNKNOWN**,
- the receipt remains valid only if internal continuity is intact,
- the record MUST be back-filled with final anchor proof upon service restoration.

UNKNOWN is an outage placeholder — **never** a trust downgrade mechanism.

---

## 09.8 Integration with the Sovereign Arc

The Sovereign Arc defines **accountability logic**.

ts.receipt.v1 defines **evidence continuity**.

Together they complete the lawful custody chain required for institutional-grade AGI deployment.

---

## 09.9 Integration with Hardware Admission (TS-A1)

High-stakes actions require, prior to execution:

- HML™ mandate verification,
- LEI = 1™ non-regression compliance,
- pre-receipt constructability,
- admission logging.

Evidence must exist **before** irreversible autonomy proceeds.

---

## 09.10 Risks and Mitigations (Committee Level)

- Receipt forgery  
  → multi-layer hashing, admission log correlation, anchoring when available.

- Policy tampering  
  → mandate digest binding + hardware admission prerequisites.

- Metric spoofing  
  → correlation with governance signals and EVL audit trails.

- Anchor outages  
  → UNKNOWN permitted only with mandatory later back-fill.

- NeuroVest™ behavioural governance chapters
- Ledger standards for receipt schemas and examples
