# Chapter 01 — The Need for Behaviour in AI

## 01.0 Executive Statement

**Outputs are not legitimacy. Behaviour is.**  
TruthSeal™ defines AGI not as “better answers,” but as **authorised, receipted, vetoable action** that remains accountable across time, policy, and consequence.

This chapter establishes the first doctrine of the Compendium:

1) **Behaviour is the unit of sovereignty.**  
2) **Authority is proven, not assumed.**  
3) **Receipts are mandatory for legitimacy.**  
4) **A single critical breach cannot be compensated by performance elsewhere.**

---

## 01.1 Purpose & Audience

This chapter is written for:

- heads of state,  
- regulators and standards bodies,  
- sovereign compute vendors,  
- auditors,  
- and enterprises deploying high-impact systems.

English is the canonical legal language.  
Translations are explanatory only.

## 01.2 Compact Acronyms & Terms (local)

→ **AI** — Artificial Intelligence (narrow or general-purpose prediction).  
→ **AGI** — Artificial General Intelligence (behaviour under duty; authorised action).  
→ **HML™** — Human Mandate Layer (verifiable authority hierarchy).  
→ **EVL™** — Epoch Verification Ledger (tamper-evident historical memory).  
→ **QENC™** — Quantum Evidence & Coherence ProofCapsule (proof artefact for anchoring).  
→ **QCEP™** — Quantum Ecosystem Closure Protocol (epoch finalisation).  
→ **LEI = 1** — Law of Ethical Irreversibility (no regression after safer coherence is known).  
→ **ULLI™** — Universal Law of Life & Information (complete inquiry → disciplined decision → receipted action).  
→ **ULIC™** — Universal Law of Irreversible Coherence (coherence persists as governance state).  
→ **TCS** — Traykov Coherence Score (court-ready coherence metric).  
→ **ACS** — Aim Coherence Score (operational coherence used for gating).  
→ **CHS** — Coherence Health Score band (privilege banding).  
→ **ts.receipt.v1** — TruthSeal™ minimum receipt schema.  
→ **UNKNOWN (anchor fields)** — temporary placeholder only when anchoring networks are down; must be back-filled inside the policy window.

## 01.3 The Behaviour Gap

Modern systems can generate impressive outputs.  
But **state-grade legitimacy** requires more than capability.

Without:

- a verifiable mandate (**HML™**),  
- end-to-end receipts (**ts.receipt.v1**),  
- independent veto lanes,  
- enforced **LEI = 1**,  
- and epoch finalisation (**EVL/QENC/QCEP**),

a system cannot claim lawful public behaviour.

TruthSeal™ exists to close this gap.

---

## 01.4 Constitutional Anchors (Behaviour View)

- **ULLI™**: inquiry must end in **receipted action**.  
- **ULIC™**: coherent governance states persist as the baseline.  
- **LEI = 1**: safer coherence forbids regression to known risk.  
- **HML™**: no mandate, no act.  
- **EVL/QENC/QCEP**: evidence during, proof at close, history finalised.

---

## 01.5 What Counts as Behaviour (Public Rule)

A step qualifies as lawful behaviour only when:

1) it binds to a **single accountable identity** under a published **mandate_ref**,  
2) it emits a **receipt** adequate for reconstruction,  
3) it is **gated** by operational coherence and is **vetoable** by an independent lane,  
4) it obeys **LEI = 1**,  
5) if epoch-bound, it aligns to **QCEP** closure duties.

---

## 01.6 Behaviour Charter (Public-Operational)

1) **No mandate, no act.**  
2) **No receipt, no claim.**  
3) **No independent veto lane, no high-stakes deployment.**  
4) **LEI = 1 is binding; monotone remediation only.**  
5) **Closure on cadence; history cannot be rewritten.**

---

## 01.7 Minimum Receipt Standard (ts.receipt.v1)

A valid operational receipt must support lawful reconstruction and include:

- identity binding and mandate reference,  
- policy version,  
- model version and integrity hash,  
- data lineage reference where applicable,  
- gate state,  
- anomaly flags,  
- anchoring fields when networks are available.

If anchoring networks are down, anchor fields may be marked **UNKNOWN** temporarily and must be back-filled within the declared policy window.

---

## 01.8 “Done” Criteria (Chapter 01)

This chapter is complete when it clearly establishes that:

- **behaviour** is the unit of sovereignty,  
- authority requires **HML + receipts + veto + LEI = 1**,  
- the doctrine is **non-compensatory**,  
- and the Compendium’s custody posture is unambiguous.
