## Acronyms & Terms (local)
| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **AI** | Artificial Intelligence (narrow or general-purpose prediction). |
| **AGI** | Artificial General Intelligence (behaviour under duty; see later doctrine). |

| **QENC™** | Quantum Evidence & Coherence ProofCapsule (proof artifact for anchoring). |
| **QCEP™** | Quantum Ecosystem Closure Protocol (epoch finalisation). |
| **LEI = 1** | Law of Ethical Irreversibility (no regression after safer coherence is known). |

| **CHS** | Coherence Health band controlling privilege. |
| **ts.receipt.v1** | TruthSeal™ minimum receipt schema for governed actions. |

## 01.0 Executive Statement
**Outputs are not legitimacy. Behaviour is.**  
TruthSeal™ defines AGI not as “better answers,” but as **authorised, receipted, vetoable action** that is accountable in time.

---

## 01.1 Purpose (Public-Operational)
This chapter establishes **behaviour** as the primary unit of certification for advanced AI systems and defines the minimal public doctrine that separates:

- high-capability output  
from  
- lawful, audited, enforceable action.

---

## 01.2 Audience
This chapter is written for sovereign authorities, regulators, auditors, critical infrastructure operators, and enterprise custodians of high-impact AI systems.

English is the canonical legal language.  
Doctorantura content is internal custody until a formal public release gate is issued.

---

## 01.3 The Behaviour Gap
Modern models can generate accurate text, plans, and simulations.  
But without:

1) **a verified mandate**,  
2) **receipt-contiguous execution**,  
3) **an independent veto lane**,  
4) **LEI = 1 enforcement**, and  
5) **finalised history**,  

their outputs cannot be certified as safe public behaviour.

**TruthSeal™ exists to close this gap.**

---

## 01.4 Core Public Anchors
TruthSeal™ binds behaviour to five invariants:

- **HML™** — no mandate, no act.  
- **ts.receipt.v1** — no receipt, no claim.  
- **Independent veto** — no veto lane, no privileged autonomy.  
- **LEI = 1** — monotone remediation only.  
- **EVL → QENC → QCEP** — evidence during, proof at close, history finalised.

---

## 01.5 Definition: What Counts as Behaviour
A system step qualifies as governed behaviour only if it:

1) binds to **a single accountable identity** under an authorised **mandate_ref**,  
2) emits a **receipt** with reason, gate state, and anomaly flags,  
3) is **gated** by coherence thresholds and **vetoable** by an independent lane,  
4) obeys **LEI = 1**,  
5) is eligible for epoch record and closure when required.

Anything else is output, not certified behaviour.

---

## 01.6 Behaviour Charter (Public Rule)
**1) No mandate, no act.**  
**2) No receipt, no claim.**  
**3) No veto lane, no privileged autonomy.**  
**4) LEI = 1 forbids regression.**  
**5) History must be finalised on cadence.**

---

## 01.7 Minimal Gate Logic (plain)
A governed action is allowed only when:

- **mandate_ref is valid**, and  
- **receipts are contiguous**, and  
- **no critical anomaly flag is present**, and  
- **the system is within its authorised CHS band**.

A **single critical breach** triggers restriction.  
Performance in unrelated areas cannot compensate.

---

## 01.8 Public Failure Triggers
Any of the following voids privileged authority:

- missing mandate,  
- receipt discontinuity,  
- failed veto readiness,  
- ethics violation under LEI = 1,  
- tampered integrity evidence,  
- unclosed or contested epoch where closure is required.

---

## 01.9 Audit Minimums
An independent auditor must be able to reconstruct:

1) who was authorised,  
2) what was attempted,  
3) which gate ruled the action,  
4) which veto lane could intervene,  
5) which receipts prove the chain,  
6) where the event sits in EVL/QENC/QCEP.

Narrative claims are not evidence.

---

## 01.10 Canonical Statement
**TruthSeal™ treats behaviour as the unit of sovereignty.**  
Intelligence becomes certifiable only when authority is:

- **role-bound**,  
- **receipt-proven**,  
- **non-compensatorily gated**, and  
- **irreversibly safer under LEI = 1**.
