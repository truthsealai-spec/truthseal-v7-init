## Acronyms & Terms (local to this chapter)
AI — Artificial Intelligence (narrow or general-purpose prediction).  
AGI — Artificial General Intelligence (behaviour under duty; see Chapter 03).  
HML™ — Human Mandate Layer (registry of Owners/Guardians/Operators/Regulators with verifiable authority).  
EVL™ — Epoch Verification Ledger (tamper-evident historical memory).  
QENC™ — Quantum Evidence & Coherence ProofCapsule (packaged proof artifact for anchoring).  
QCEP™ — Quantum Ecosystem Closure Protocol (epoch finalisation so history cannot be rewritten).  
LEI = 1 — Law of Ethical Irreversibility (once a safer coherent path is known, regression to risk is impermissible).  
ULLI™ — Universal Law of Life & Information (complete inquiry → fit method → disciplined novelty → determinate decision → receipted action).  
ULIC™ — Universal Law of Irreversible Coherence (coherence, once achieved, persists as a governance state).  
TCS — Traykov Coherence Score (0…1; court-ready coherence).  
ACS — Aim Coherence Score (0…1; operational coherence used for gating).  
CHS — Coherence Health band (L/M/H/UH) controlling privilege.  
ts.receipt.v1 — TruthSeal™ minimum receipt schema.  
UNKNOWN (anchor fields) — temporary placeholder only when external anchoring is down; must be back-filled inside the defined policy window.

## Executive Statement
Outputs are not legitimacy.  
**Behaviour** is legitimacy.

TruthSeal™ treats behaviour—not raw capability—as the unit of lawful authority.  
A system becomes publicly admissible only when its behaviour is:

- authorised by human mandate,  
- recorded by receipts,  
- vetoable by an independent control lane,  
- constrained by LEI = 1,  
- and anchored into finalised history.

This chapter sets the doctrine foundation for that threshold.

---

## The Behaviour Gap
Modern systems can draft, predict, and optimise.  
But without enforceable custody, they cannot be trusted to act.

A step becomes **lawful behaviour** only when it binds to:
1) a valid **mandate_ref** under HML™,  
2) a contiguous receipt trail under ts.receipt.v1,  
3) independent vetoability,  
4) monotone safety under LEI = 1,  
5) and epoch-grade historical finality (EVL → QENC → QCEP).

Anything less is **output**, not authorised action.

---

## Behaviour Charter (Public-Operational Rule)
1) **No mandate, no act.**  
2) **No receipt, no claim.**  
3) **No veto lane, no deployment beyond controlled environments.**  
4) **LEI = 1 forbids regression after safer coherence is known.**  
5) **History is closed on cadence; it cannot be rewritten.**

## Operational Model (minimal and court-safe)

### State
S(t) = { identity_id, context, memory_integrity, receipt_continuity, ethics_state }

### Metrics
ACS(t) ∈ [0,1] — operational coherence for real-time gating  
TCS(t) ∈ [0,1] — court-grade coherence for legitimacy claims  
CHS ∈ {L, M, H, UH} — privilege band

### Minimum Receipt (ts.receipt.v1)
`sha256, reason, mandate_ref, gate_state, anomaly_flags,`  
`ots_calendar_id, ots_status, ots_tx, originstamp_id, btcstamp_tx, anchored_rfc3339`

Policy rule: if anchoring networks are down, anchor fields may be **UNKNOWN**  
and must be back-filled within the declared policy limit.

### Gate Rule (plain)
- If ACS and TCS meet policy thresholds and no hard flags → **ALLOW**  
- If recoverable weakness → **SOFT_GATE**  
- If mandate mismatch, receipt gap, critical integrity or ethics breach → **HARD_HALT**

### LEI = 1 Recovery Rule
During authorised remediation, the next safe state must not be worse than the present.  
Recovery is **monotone** until the required coherence frontier is restored.

---

## Failure Conditions (behaviour view)
- missing or invalid mandate_ref  
- broken receipt continuity  
- absent independent veto path  
- regression to a riskier known alternative  
- unfinalised history for claims that require closure

Each condition blocks public legitimacy.

---

## Chapter 01 “Done” Criteria
This chapter is complete when it:
- defines behaviour as the primary unit of legitimacy,  
- binds mandates, receipts, veto, LEI = 1, and closure into one threshold,  
- presents a minimal, enforceable behavioural rule-set,  
- keeps doctrine strictly internal and custody-bound.
