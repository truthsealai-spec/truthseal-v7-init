TRUTHSEAL™ DOCTORANTURA — THE SOVEREIGN ARC OF AGI FRAMEWORK v1.0
Strict Internal Doctrine — Not for Public Use

date: 10 December 2025

# Chapter 01 — The Need for Behaviour in AI
version: 1.0  
status: Draft — Doctorantura Edition — Internal Custody  
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.), Founder & Chief Architect of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework

## 01.0 Executive Statement

**Outputs are not legitimacy. Behaviour is.**  

TruthSeal™ treats AGI not as “better answers”, but as  
**authorised, receipted, vetoable action** that remains accountable across  
time, policy, and consequence.

This chapter establishes the first doctrine of the Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework:

1. **Behaviour is the unit of sovereignty.**  
2. **Authority is proven, not assumed.**  
3. **Receipts are mandatory for legitimacy.**  
4. **A single critical breach cannot be compensated by performance elsewhere.**

---

## 01.1 Purpose & Audience

This chapter is written for:

- heads of state and security councils,  
- regulators and standards bodies,  
- sovereign compute vendors and chip manufacturers,  
- auditors and assurance firms,  
- enterprises deploying high-impact decision systems.

English is the **canonical legal language**.  
Other languages may be provided as **explanatory translations**, but they do not override the English legal meaning.

## 01.2 Compact Acronyms & Terms (local)

→ **AI** — Artificial Intelligence (narrow or general-purpose prediction).  
→ **AGI** — Artificial General Intelligence (behaviour under duty; authorised action with receipts).  
→ **HML™** — Human Mandate Layer (registry of Owners, Guardians, Operators, and Regulators with verifiable authority).  
→ **EVL™** — Epoch Verification Ledger (tamper-evident historical memory of decisions and receipts).  
→ **QENC™** — Quantum Evidence & Coherence ProofCapsule (packaged proof artefact used for anchoring).  
→ **QCEP™** — Quantum Ecosystem Closure Protocol (epoch finalisation so history cannot be rewritten).  
→ **LEI = 1** — Law of Ethical Irreversibility (once a safer coherent path is known, regression to higher risk is forbidden).  
→ **ULLI™** — Universal Law of Life & Information (complete inquiry → fit method → disciplined novelty → determinate decision → receipted action).  
→ **ULIC™** — Universal Law of Irreversible Coherence (coherence, once achieved, persists as a governance state).  
→ **TCS** — Traykov Coherence Score (0…1; court-ready coherence; bands such as Baseline/Silver/Gold/Diamond).  
→ **ACS** — Aim Coherence Score (0…1; operational coherence used for gating and privilege).  
→ **CHS** — Coherence Health Score band (L/M/H/UH) governing operational privilege.  
→ **ts.receipt.v1** — TruthSeal™ minimum receipt schema binding identity, policy, model, and anchors.  
→ **UNKNOWN (anchor fields)** — temporary placeholder only when external anchoring is unavailable; must be back-filled within the declared policy window.

## 01.3 The Behaviour Gap

Modern systems can generate **convincing output**: text, plans, simulations, and designs.  
But **state-grade legitimacy** cannot be granted to output alone.

Without:

- a verifiable mandate (**HML™**),  
- end-to-end receipts (**ts.receipt.v1**),  
- independent veto lanes,  
- enforced **LEI = 1**,  
- and finalised history (**EVL™ / QENC™ / QCEP™**),

no system can legitimately claim to act as a **sovereign-grade agent**.

TruthSeal™ exists to **close this behaviour gap**:  
it converts raw capability into **governed behaviour** that is attributable, auditable, and stoppable.

---

## 01.4 Constitutional Anchors (Behaviour View)

TruthSeal™ grounds the behaviour doctrine in four constitutional anchors:

- **ULLI™** — inquiry must end in **receipted action**, not just prediction.  
- **ULIC™** — once a coherent governance state is achieved, it persists as the baseline; weakening it is not permitted.  
- **LEI = 1** — knowing a safer coherent path forbids deliberate regression to higher-risk behaviour.  
- **HML™** — authority must be human-mandated and registry-bound: **no mandate, no act**.

These anchors are then recorded and proven through **EVL™, QENC™, and QCEP™**, providing:

- evidence during operation,  
- proof at closure,  
- and a finalised history that cannot be quietly rewritten.

---

## 01.5 What Counts as Behaviour (Public Rule)

Under TruthSeal™, a step qualifies as **lawful behaviour** only when all of the following hold:

1. It binds to a **single accountable identity** under a published **mandate_ref** in **HML™**.  
2. It emits a **receipt** sufficient for lawful reconstruction (ts.receipt.v1 or stronger).  
3. It is **gated** by ACS/TCS thresholds and is **vetoable** by an independent control lane.  
4. It obeys **LEI = 1** — no authorised decision may knowingly regress to a more dangerous path.  
5. If it belongs to an epoch or campaign, it aligns to **QCEP™** closure duties and appears in **EVL™**.

Anything less may be **output** or **simulation**, but it is **not behaviour** in the TruthSeal™ sense.

---

## 01.6 Behaviour Charter (Public-Operational)

TruthSeal™ expresses the doctrine in five operational rules:

1. **No mandate, no act.**  
2. **No receipt, no claim.**  
3. **No independent veto lane, no high-stakes deployment.**  
4. **LEI = 1 is binding; remediation must be monotone toward higher coherence.**  
5. **Closure on cadence; history cannot be quietly rewritten.**

These rules are **non-compensatory**:  
a single critical breach is not cancelled by good performance elsewhere.

---

## 01.7 Minimum Receipt Standard (ts.receipt.v1)

A valid operational receipt must support **forensic reconstruction** and typically includes:

- identity binding and **mandate_ref**,  
- policy version and doctrine reference,  
- model version and integrity hash,  
- data lineage reference where applicable,  
- gate state (ALLOW / SOFT_GATE / HARD_HALT),  
- anomaly flags,  
- anchoring fields (e.g. OpenTimestamps / other ledgers) when networks are available.

If anchoring networks are temporarily unavailable, anchor fields may be set to **UNKNOWN** but must be **back-filled** within the declared **anchor_backfill_max_h** policy window.  
Failure to back-fill is treated as an **integrity breach** and may trigger a downgrade in **CHS** and operational privilege.

---

## 01.8 “Done” Criteria (Chapter 01)

Chapter 01 is considered **doctrinally complete** when it:

- clearly states that **behaviour**, not output, is the **unit of sovereignty**,  
- binds behaviour to **HML™, receipts, veto lanes, LEI = 1, and closure**,  
- makes the **non-compensatory enforcement rule** explicit,  
- and fixes the custody posture as **Doctorantura, internal, and non-public**.

Later chapters may **refine** details and add mechanisms (e.g. NeuroVest™, DEVORA™, PODAPAR™),  
but they may **not weaken** the baseline established here.
