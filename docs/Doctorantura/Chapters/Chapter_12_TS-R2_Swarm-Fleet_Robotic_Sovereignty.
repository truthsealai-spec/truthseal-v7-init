## 12.1 Purpose and Outcome

This chapter defines **TS-R2™**, the sovereign governance doctrine for **multiple embodied agents acting in coordination**.

TS-R2™ governs:
- swarms,
- fleets,
- convoys,
- drone matrices,
- household clusters,
- industrial robotic cells.

Its purpose is to ensure that **collective physical intelligence** remains:
- coherence-bounded,
- hierarchy-governed,
- fault-isolating,
- receipt-visible,
- and legally accountable as a single operational entity.

---

## 12.2 Why TS-R2™ Is Required

Single-agent governance (TS-R1™) is insufficient when:
- responsibility diffuses across agents,
- decisions emerge from coordination,
- harm is caused by interaction rather than intent.

TS-R2™ exists to prevent:
- “rogue swarm” behavior,
- diluted accountability,
- untraceable collective harm,
- silent regression through group dynamics.

It binds **many agents into one accountable sovereign surface**.

---

## 12.3 Doctrine Boundary

This chapter defines **committee-stable TS-R2™ doctrine**.

It does not disclose:
- Ω swarm control logic,
- sealed enforcement mathematics,
- tactical defense thresholds,
- classified optimization heuristics.

---

## 12.4 Relationship to TS-R1™

TS-R2™ is strictly layered:

- **TS-R1™** governs each unit’s behavior, duty, and receipts.
- **TS-R2™** governs how units coordinate, escalate, isolate, and inherit responsibility.

**Every TS-R2™ swarm requires TS-R1™ installed on every member.**

No exception.

---

## 12.5 Swarm Structure and Authority Topology

TS-R2™ enforces a **lawful command hierarchy**:

**Human Mandate  
→ Swarm Core  
→ Cluster Controller  
→ Individual Unit**

Rules:
- Authority flows downward.
- Veto power flows upward.
- Emergency signals may propagate upward instantly.
- No lateral authority bypass is permitted.

This prevents circular command, shadow leadership, or emergent dominance.

---

## 12.6 Collective CHS™ — Unified Privilege Layer

CHS™ governs **both individual and collective permission**.

A swarm’s effective operating band is:

**min(CHS of all active members, historical swarm CHS stability)**

Implications:
- One degraded unit can down-band a cluster.
- Systemic instability down-bands the entire swarm.
- Promotion requires sustained stability across time and ledger history.

The swarm **cannot self-declare maturity**.

---

## 12.7 Collective Duty and Fault Propagation

TS-R2™ enforces **explicit fault handling mechanics**.

When incoherence, harm, or near-harm occurs:

1. **Immediate Isolation**  
   The originating unit is isolated from collective actuation.

2. **Containment Ring**  
   Neighboring units enter restricted mode pending assessment.

3. **Collective Band Review**  
   If risk is systemic, swarm CHS™ is down-banded automatically.

4. **Receipt Emission**  
   The swarm emits:
   - origin receipt,
   - response receipt,
   - mitigation receipt.

No fault may remain local and silent.

---

## 12.8 Distributed Accountability with Single Origin

Every material act must be reconstructable:

- which unit acted,
- under which mandate,
- under which CHS™ band,
- which agents influenced the outcome,
- how the swarm responded.

**There is no “the swarm did it.”**

Responsibility always resolves to a traceable origin.

---

## 12.9 Fleet Memory and Irreversibility

TS-R2™ extends NeuroVest™ across the collective.

Rules:
- Safety lessons learned by one unit become constraints on all.
- Regressed behavior cannot be reintroduced through replacement units.
- Fleet memory persists across upgrades, replacements, and reconfiguration.

This enforces **ULIC™ inheritance at scale**.

---

## 12.10 Receipts and Ledger Continuity

TS-R2™ requires:
- individual unit receipts,
- collective swarm receipts,
- synchronized mandate references,
- reconstructable timelines.

EVL™ links:
- unit history,
- cluster history,
- swarm history.

QENC™ packages collective proof.

---

## 12.11 Mandatory Domains

TS-R2™ governance is mandatory wherever:
- multiple robots operate in shared space,
- public or critical infrastructure is involved,
- collective emergent behavior is possible.

Examples include logistics fleets, disaster response, defense perimeters, ports, households, and industrial yards.

---

## 12.12 Minimum Compliance Conditions

A system is **not TS-R2™ compliant** unless:

- TS-A1 AEGIS™ admission is present,
- TS-R1™ governs every unit,
- unified CHS™ gating is enforced,
- NeuroVest™ collective memory is active,
- EVL™ + QENC™ output is configured,
- human mandate authority is bound,
- safe swarm disintegration logic exists.

Any missing element disqualifies sovereignty.

---

## 12.13 Canonical One-Line Definition

**TS-R2™ is the law that binds many physical agents into one accountable, irreversible, and auditable sovereign system.**
