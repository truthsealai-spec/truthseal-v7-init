# Chapter 07 — Irreversibility as Law (LEI = 1)

## 07.0 Purpose

This chapter defines **LEI = 1 — the Law of Ethical Irreversibility** as a binding constitutional law of the Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework.

It establishes that once a safer, more coherent, and legally valid behavioural state is known and receipted, **regression to a weaker or riskier state is forbidden**, regardless of convenience, performance pressure, or operational cost.

LEI = 1 is not a guideline.
It is a **non-reversible constraint on behaviour, upgrades, recovery, and governance**.

---

## 07.1 Formal Statement of LEI = 1

**Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1):**

Once a safer, clearer, and more coherent behavioural pattern is known, validated, and receipted,  
any regression to a less safe or less coherent pattern is impermissible.

This applies across:
- time,
- versions,
- jurisdictions,
- recovery modes,
- hardware states,
- and human override scenarios.

Violation of LEI = 1 constitutes a **hard constitutional breach**.

---

## 07.2 Relationship to Foundational Laws

LEI = 1 operates in concert with, but is distinct from:

- **ULLI™ (Universal Law of Life & Information)**  
  Inquiry → disciplined decision → receipted action.

- **ULIC™ (Universal Law of Irreversible Coherence)**  
  Coherent governance states must persist once achieved.

LEI = 1 is the **ethical enforcement vector** of ULIC™.
It ensures that coherence, once proven safer, cannot be abandoned.

---

## 07.3 Domains of Enforcement

LEI = 1 applies uniformly to:

1. **Model behaviour**  
   - response patterns,
   - refusal logic,
   - safety handling,
   - uncertainty handling.

2. **System upgrades and rollbacks**  
   - software versions,
   - policy packs,
   - hardware firmware,
   - model weights.

3. **Recovery and remediation paths**  
   - incident response,
   - safety patching,
   - post-breach hardening.

4. **Human override and mandate**  
   - license issuance,
   - license revocation,
   - emergency intervention.

No domain is exempt.

---

## 07.4 Operational Interpretation

Under LEI = 1:

- If a safer refusal pattern is discovered, weaker refusals are forbidden.
- If a safer mitigation exists, riskier mitigations are forbidden.
- If a patched vulnerability is known, reopening it is forbidden.
- If uncertainty is detected, **UNKNOWN** is lawful; guessing is not.

LEI = 1 explicitly **permits halting**, **refusal**, and **non-response** when coherence would otherwise degrade.

---

## 07.5 Recovery Without Regression

Recovery after failure must follow **monotone improvement**:

- Safety metrics must not degrade.
- Coherence metrics must not degrade.
- Ethical constraints must not be loosened.

If recovery requires regression to regain function, **the system must remain halted** until a non-regressive path is found.

Operational availability is subordinate to ethical irreversibility.

---

## 07.6 Interaction with Human Mandate Layer (HML™)

Human authority does not override LEI = 1.

Under HML™:
- Humans may **permit**, **veto**, or **halt** actions.
- Humans may **not authorise regression** to a known worse state.

A human instruction that violates LEI = 1 must be refused, receipted, and escalated.

This protects:
- operators from coercion,
- institutions from liability,
- and society from rollback-driven harm.

---

## 07.7 Enforcement Mechanisms

LEI = 1 is enforced through:

- **Unitary Integrity Function (UIF)**  
  Non-compensatory Boolean gate; any LEI violation results in VETO.

- **DecisionReceipts (ts.receipt.v1)**  
  Recording refusal, halt, or denial with forensic flags.

- **EVL™ (Epoch Verification Ledger)**  
  Tamper-evident record of irreversible transitions.

- **QENC™ (Quantum Evidence & Coherence ProofCapsule)**  
  Cryptographic proof that irreversibility was preserved.

- **Third Guardian Firewall™**  
  Final veto lane enforcing HARD-HALT on LEI breach.

---

## 07.8 Legal and Institutional Significance

LEI = 1 establishes that:

- ethical improvements are **one-way**,  
- safety cannot be bargained away,  
- and regression is evidence of negligence or malfeasance.

For courts and regulators, LEI = 1 provides:
- a clear audit rule,
- a binary test for breach,
- and a defensible standard of care.

---

## 07.9 Canonical Statement

Under the Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework:

- LEI = 1 is binding law.
- Regression to known worse states is forbidden.
- Availability never outweighs coherence.
- Human authority cannot legitimise ethical rollback.
- When in doubt, the lawful response is **UNKNOWN** or **HALT**.

This chapter defines irreversibility as a **constitutional property of ethical AI governance**.
