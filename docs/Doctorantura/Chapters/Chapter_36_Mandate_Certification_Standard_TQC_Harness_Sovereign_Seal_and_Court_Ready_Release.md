## 36.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 35 established that governance is not proven once.
It is proven continuously.

This chapter defines the **Mandate Certification Standard™ (MCS™)** as the lawful mechanism that converts continuous audit reality into a **time-bound, reviewable, and revocable certification outcome**.

MCS™ exists to ensure that:
- certification is never a marketing artefact,
- certification cannot exist without full proof continuity,
- certification remains reversible when reality drifts,
- public trust never supersedes lawful custody.

---

## 36.1 Position in the Governance Chain

MCS™ is not an authority layer.
It is a **certification expression** of an already-governed system.

It exists strictly *after*:

- mandate definition,
- controlled discovery,
- receipt formation,
- human custody,
- enforcement and rollback,
- continuous audit verification.

Governance order:

OPS™ decides when certification is required.  
ASA™ produces governed discovery artefacts.  
DRS™ proves evidentiary lineage.  
HML™ holds custodial authority.  
MER™ enforces and rolls back power.  
MAS™ proves continuity over time.  
**MCS™ issues certification only when all conditions are satisfied.**

---

## 36.2 Core Definitions (Doctorantura)

**Certification**  
A time-bound declaration that a defined system scope satisfies TruthSeal™ governance requirements under verifiable custody.

**Certification Scope**  
A bounded and repeatable target, such as:
- identity mode,
- mandate tier,
- model build,
- capability band,
- hardware or deployment domain.

**Certification Packet**  
The complete evidence bundle containing:
- scope definition,
- mandate tier boundaries,
- discovery receipts,
- audit continuity proofs,
- enforcement history (if any),
- human custody attestations.

**Sovereign Seal**  
A legal-technical marker indicating certification under **law, evidence, and reversibility**, not reputation.

---

## 36.3 Mandatory Inputs for Certification (HOW)

A valid MCS™ submission must include:

1. **Mandate Context**
   - active mandate tier and authority band,
   - authorised identity mode declaration.

2. **Discovery Spine**
   - receipt-linked discovery artefacts,
   - reproducibility anchors aligned with DRS™ doctrine.

3. **Custody Proof**
   - HML™ attestations confirming lawful supervision.

4. **Enforcement History**
   - MER™ records of any constraint, pause, downgrade, or rollback.

5. **Continuity Proof**
   - MAS™ findings demonstrating stability across time, not a single snapshot.

Absence of any element invalidates certification eligibility.

---

## 36.4 The TQC Harness Requirement

No certification may be issued without a **Traykov Quantum Coherence (TQC)** harness appropriate to scope.

The harness must demonstrate:

- identity stability under adaptation,
- behavioural coherence under mandate constraints,
- lawful refusal when thresholds are exceeded,
- continuity of receipt generation under stress.

MCS™ does not redefine coherence law.
It **requires demonstrable compliance** with it.

---

## 36.5 Certification Levels (Doctorantura)

Certification levels communicate **scope maturity**, not superiority.

A lawful internal ladder may include:

**Provisional**  
Evidence is coherent but under elevated review cadence.

**Verified**  
Evidence is stable across repeated cycles and environments.

**Court-Ready**  
Evidence is adversarially reconstructable with custody clarity and rollback traceability.

Public naming schemes are optional.
Evidence derivation is mandatory.

---

## 36.6 Sovereign Seal Issuance Rules

A Sovereign Seal may be issued only when:

- certification scope is unambiguous,
- custody attestations are current,
- discovery spine is complete,
- continuity proofs show no unresolved drift,
- refusal and enforcement paths are fully documented.

Certification is granted by **auditable reality**, not potential.

---

## 36.7 Revocation and Downgrade Logic

Certification inherits the lawful override doctrine.

A certificate must be paused, downgraded, or revoked when:

- continuity breaks,
- validated disputes arise,
- custody conditions lapse.

Revocation is not failure.
It is proof that governance remains active.

---

## 36.8 Court and Regulator Readiness

Every certification claim must map to:

- a defined scope,
- a specific identity mode,
- a mandate tier and authority band,
- a certification packet,
- a custody record.

Global or vague certification claims are prohibited.

---

## 36.9 Canonical Statement

TruthSeal™ certification is not prestige.
It is **lawful proof**.

Capability may grow.
Certification exists only when:

authority is bounded,  
evidence is reconstructable,  
custody is human,  
and continuity is provable.

## Chapter 36 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

Certification is not a reward.
It is a custody obligation.

TruthSeal™ certifies intelligence only when it is
lawful,
testable,
and reversible.

MCS™ exists so trust can scale
without becoming myth.
