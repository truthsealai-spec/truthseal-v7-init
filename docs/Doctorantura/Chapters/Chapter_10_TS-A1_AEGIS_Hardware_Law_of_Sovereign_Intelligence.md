## 10.1 Purpose and Outcome

This chapter defines **TS-A1 AEGIS™** as the hardware-bound enforcement law that makes
TruthSeal™ governance **physically unavoidable** at execution time.

It establishes TS-A1 as:

• the admission authority for high-stakes computation  
• the non-regression enforcement substrate under **LEI = 1™**  
• the hardware witness that emits court-ready governance evidence  

This chapter is **committee-level doctrine**.  
Deeper Ω enforcement mechanics remain sealed under Doctorantura.

---

## 10.2 Definition

**TS-A1 AEGIS™** is the hardware law that binds computation to:

• irreversible coherence  
• privilege gating  
• cryptographic accountability  

It ensures that no high-impact execution can occur outside the active governance law,
regardless of software intent, model state, or operator pressure.

---

## 10.3 Doctrinal Position in the TruthSeal™ Stack

TS-A1 AEGIS™ is the **first Implementation Law** in the TruthSeal™ doctrine chain:

• **ULLI™** — establishes infinite inquiry and responsible evolution  
• **ULIC™** — binds irreversible coherence inheritance across time  
• **LEI = 1™** — forbids ethical regression once responsibility is known  
• **TS-A1 AEGIS™** — enforces these laws at the execution substrate  

If NeuroVest™ governs behaviour,  
TS-A1 governs **capability itself**.

---

## 10.4 Why Hardware Law Is Required

Software governance alone is not sovereign-grade.

At scale:

• software controls can be bypassed  
• models can be retrained into misalignment  
• runtime policies can be overridden under stress  

Hardware law removes optional compliance.

TS-A1 converts governance from *agreement* into *architecture*.

---

## 10.5 Sovereign Functions

TS-A1 AEGIS™ performs three non-delegable sovereign functions:

### 10.5.1 Coherence Enforcement

Blocks execution paths that:

• violate **LEI = 1™**  
• increase coherence distance  
• trigger ethical or stability regression  

Regression is not discouraged — it is **physically blocked**.

---

### 10.5.2 Privilege Gating

Binds execution authority to **Coherence Health Score (CHS)** bands.

• Permissions cannot be self-declared  
• Escalation requires lawful metric state  
• Downgrades occur automatically on degradation  

Capability becomes conditional, not assumed.

---

### 10.5.3 Receipt Emission

Generates hardware-level receipts and state traces that feed:

• Epoch Verification Ledger (EVL)  
• Quantum Evidence & Coherence ProofCapsule (QENC™)  

The processor becomes a **governance witness**.

---

## 10.6 Core Control Blocks

TS-A1 AEGIS™ contains three mandatory enforcement blocks.

### 10.6.1 Irreversible Commitment Gate (ICG)

The **ICG** performs admission checks for irreversible or high-risk execution:

• verifies Aim Coherence Score directionality  
• rejects any path that increases coherence distance  
• enforces non-regression in silicon  

No commit proceeds without lawful proof.

---

### 10.6.2 Purity Monitoring System (PMS)

The **PMS** provides continuous runtime sensing:

• monitors drift and instability  
• detects ethical load violations  
• triggers real-time privilege degradation  

Purity loss immediately constrains capability.

---

### 10.6.3 Self-Adjoint Diagonalizer (SAD)

The **SAD** enforces forced convergence:

• compares current state to the terminal coherence target  
• flags divergence  
• mandates correction under the NeuroVest™ regime  

This is the hardware embodiment of convergence law.

---

## 10.7 Relationship to Metrics

TS-A1 enforces — but does not define — the following metrics:

• **TCS™** — Traykov Coherence Score  
• **ACS™** — Aim Coherence Score  
• **CHS** — Coherence Health Score bands  

Metrics become **execution constraints**, not dashboards.

---

## 10.8 Ledger and Evidence Integration

TS-A1 emits:

• hardware receipts  
• veto and halt logs  
• convergence deltas  

These bind directly into:

• EVL continuity  
• QENC™ proof chains  

Governance evidence originates at execution.

---

## 10.9 Sovereign Qualification Rule

A processor **cannot** be TruthSeal-grade unless:

1. TS-A1 AEGIS™ control blocks are present  
2. LEI = 1™ enforcement is hardware-achievable  
3. Receipt emission is audit-continuous  

Absence of any element disqualifies sovereign classification.

---

## 10.10 Canonical Definition

**TS-A1 AEGIS™ is the hardware law that binds computation to irreversible coherence,
privilege gating, and cryptographic accountability.**
