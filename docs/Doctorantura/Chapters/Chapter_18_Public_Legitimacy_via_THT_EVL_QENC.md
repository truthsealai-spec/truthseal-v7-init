## 18.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines how **internal TruthSeal™ coherence becomes externally undeniable public legitimacy**.

If prior chapters establish:
• what governed intelligence must be,
• how it is constrained,
• and how it is measured under non-compensatory law,

then this chapter defines **how that reality is proven to the world**.

Public legitimacy is not narrative.
It is evidence.

TruthSeal™ achieves legitimacy through the combined operation of:

• **THT Protocol™** — truth handling, hashing, timestamping  
• **EVL™ (Epoch Verification Ledger)** — chronological governance continuity  
• **QENC™** — sovereign integrity & identity evidence capsule  

---

## 18.1 The Legitimacy Problem

Modern AI systems can demonstrate performance without proving:

• identity continuity  
• authority provenance  
• consequence ownership  
• lawful auditability  
• irreversibility of remediation  

This creates a legitimacy gap:

A system may function,
yet remain **civically inadmissible**.

TruthSeal™ exists to close this gap.

---

## 18.2 Canonical Rule (TruthSeal™ Interpretation)

In TruthSeal™ doctrine:

**Legitimacy is a function of evidence, not claims.**

A system is legitimate only when:

• its identity is traceable through time  
• its integrity is cryptographically anchored  
• its authority is receipt-bound  
• its remediation history is monotone under LEI = 1™  

Absent evidence, legitimacy does not exist.

---

## 18.3 Instrument I — THT Protocol™ (Truth Discipline)

The THT Protocol™ defines how internal events become provable facts.

THT™ requires:

• canonical representation of governed state  
• cryptographic hashing for integrity binding  
• timestamping for temporal truth  
• anchor-ready output for independent verification  

THT™ is the **grammar of legitimacy**.
Without it, evidence cannot be formed.

---

## 18.4 Instrument II — EVL™ (Temporal Sovereignty)

The Epoch Verification Ledger™ (EVL™) ensures that:

• governance history cannot be rewritten  
• upgrades cannot erase prior states  
• breaches cannot be hidden  
• recovery cannot be back-dated  

EVL™ binds:

• policy evolution  
• CHS™ band transitions  
• mandate changes  
• breach and remediation epochs  

into a single irreversible timeline.

EVL™ makes time itself a witness.

---

## 18.5 Instrument III — QENC™ (Evidence Capsule)

QENC™ is the sovereign evidence container.

It binds, at a given epoch:

• declared system identity  
• integrity state hash  
• governing policy references  
• mandate authority  
• verification pointers  

QENC™ allows courts, regulators, insurers, and auditors
to verify legitimacy **without trusting narrative**.

It is reconstructable proof, not assertion.

---

## 18.6 Receipt-First Legitimacy Minimums

A TruthSeal™-legitimate public system must expose:

1) System identity declaration  
2) Active mandate and policy set  
3) Integrity hash of governed state  
4) Non-compensatory gating declaration  
5) Accountable human authority reference  
6) Timestamped reconstruction pointers  

If any element is missing,
legitimacy is suspended.

---

## 18.7 Non-Compensatory Legitimacy Law

TruthSeal™ rejects compensatory trust.

A system cannot offset:

• missing receipts  
• broken continuity  
• unanchored integrity  

with performance, popularity, or market success.

Legitimacy is **binary at the critical layer**.

---

## 18.8 Auditor Reconstruction Doctrine

An independent auditor must be able to confirm:

• THT™ is declared as the truth discipline  
• EVL™ is declared as the epoch ledger  
• QENC™ is declared as the integrity capsule  
• Evidence reconstructs without narrative reliance  
• LEI = 1™ monotonicity is preserved  
• Terminology matches canonical register  

If reconstruction fails, legitimacy fails.

---

## 18.9 Canonical Statement

Public legitimacy is the civilisational consequence
of internal TruthSeal™ coherence.

THT Protocol™ structures truth.  
EVL™ preserves time.  
QENC™ binds identity and integrity.

Together they ensure that governed intelligence is not merely claimed,
but **proven in time**.
