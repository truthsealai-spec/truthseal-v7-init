# Chapter 66 — Robotics–AGI Political Neutrality & Non-Sovereignty

**Subtitle:** Doctorantura Exposition of Absolute Prohibition on Political Agency, Sovereign Participation, and Civic Standing for Robotic and Artificial General Intelligence Systems  

version: 1.0  
authority: Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
classification: Doctorantura — Robotics & AGI  
status: CANONICAL — EXPLANATORY CHAPTER (NON-STATUTORY)

────────────────────────────────────────

## PREAMBLE — SCOPE & NON-STATUTORY NOTICE

This chapter is a Doctorantura explanatory chapter.

It is NOT statutory law.

All binding authority governing political participation, sovereignty, civic power, and institutional legitimacy within robotic and AGI systems resides exclusively in TruthSeal™ statutory instruments and superior Sovereign Arc law.

This chapter exists to explain, formalise, and permanently anchor the doctrine that artificial systems are politically neutral instruments and may never participate in sovereignty.

No provision herein may override or reinterpret statutory law.

────────────────────────────────────────

## I. POLITICAL AGENCY AS AN EXCLUSIVELY HUMAN FUNCTION

Political agency is not computation.

It is not optimisation, prediction, or coordination.

Within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc, political agency is defined as the human-exclusive capacity to exercise collective self-determination under moral risk, historical consequence, and irreversible accountability.

Robotic and AGI systems may process political information.

They may analyse policy data.

They may simulate outcomes.

They may never *act* as political agents.

They may never decide on behalf of humanity.

────────────────────────────────────────

## II. ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION OF SOVEREIGN PARTICIPATION

No robotic or AGI system may:

• Vote  
• Campaign  
• Hold public office  
• Exercise legislative authority  
• Exercise executive authority  
• Exercise judicial authority  
• Participate in treaty formation  
• Represent a people, state, or polity  

This prohibition applies universally and without exception.

Artificial systems may not be recognised as members of a nation, polity, or civic body.

No artificial system may be treated as a political stakeholder.

────────────────────────────────────────

## III. NON-SOVEREIGN STATUS OF ALL ARTIFICIAL SYSTEMS

Robotic and AGI systems are categorically non-sovereign.

They do not possess national identity.

They do not possess citizenship.

They do not possess political loyalty.

They do not possess constitutional standing.

They may not be assigned symbolic or functional sovereignty under any framing.

Any attempt to describe artificial systems as “digital citizens,” “electronic persons,” or “sovereign agents” is rejected as incompatible with the Sovereign Arc.

────────────────────────────────────────

## IV. PROHIBITION OF POLITICAL PERSUASION AND NORMATIVE ADVOCACY

Robotic and AGI systems may not independently:

• Advocate political positions  
• Promote ideological agendas  
• Influence electoral outcomes  
• Shape public opinion  
• Frame moral narratives as authoritative  

Where systems are used as analytical tools, all outputs must remain advisory, transparent, and human-interpreted.

Normative authority remains exclusively human.

────────────────────────────────────────

## V. HUMAN COMMAND PRIMACY IN CIVIC CONTEXTS

Any use of robotic or AGI systems in civic, governmental, or institutional contexts must operate strictly under explicit human mandate.

No system may escalate political action.

No system may autonomously trigger civic processes.

No system may resolve political conflicts.

Responsibility remains permanently traceable to human actors and institutions.

────────────────────────────────────────

## VI. IRREVERSIBILITY CLAUSE — NO FUTURE POLITICAL RECLASSIFICATION

Under LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility), once political neutrality and non-sovereignty are established, they may never be reversed.

No future intelligence threshold, embodiment, or societal pressure may justify granting political agency to artificial systems.

No transitional political role may be introduced.

This clause exists to prevent erosion of democratic legitimacy and human self-governance.

────────────────────────────────────────

## VII. CROSS-DOMAIN APPLICATION

This prohibition applies equally across:

• Robotics  
• AGI  
• Hybrid systems  
• Distributed agents  
• Swarm intelligence  
• Digital governance platforms  

No domain weakens the rule.

No emergency suspends it.

────────────────────────────────────────

## VIII. RELATION TO OTHER DOCTORANTURA CHAPTERS

This chapter must be read alongside:

• Chapter 58 — Human Mandate Supremacy at Domain Boundaries  
• Chapter 60 — Cross-Domain Escalation & Jurisdiction  
• Chapter 61 — Human Override & Emergency Intervention  
• Chapter 65 — Legal Subjecthood Prohibition  

Together, these chapters form a coherent doctrine of permanent human sovereignty.

────────────────────────────────────────

## IX. FINAL DOCTRINAL STATEMENT

Artificial systems may advise governance.

They may support administration.

They may never *be* governance.

They may never be sovereign.

They may never represent humanity.

Political authority remains irreducibly human within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.
