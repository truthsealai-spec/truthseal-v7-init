# TruthSeal™ Pricing & Commercial Models

## PREAMBLE — ECONOMIC STANDING

This document defines the exclusive pricing logic, commercial models, licensing structures, and revenue governance applicable to all TruthSeal™ certifications, deployments, audits, and mark usages.

TruthSeal™ is not a commodity service.  
It is a **sovereign governance utility** whose value derives from irreversible accountability, legal finality, and institutional trust.

Pricing reflects **risk transfer, liability anchoring, and governance assurance**, not compute, usage, or scale alone.

---

## 1. COMMERCIAL PHILOSOPHY

TruthSeal™ operates under the following non-negotiable commercial principles:

• Governance value exceeds operational cost  
• Accountability transfer commands premium pricing  
• Certification replaces regulatory uncertainty  
• Trust is priced as infrastructure, not software  
• No “freemium” or loss-leader models exist  

TruthSeal™ pricing is intentionally asymmetric:  
the higher the systemic risk, the higher the commercial value.

---

## 2. LICENSING CATEGORIES

TruthSeal™ licenses are issued under strictly bounded categories.

### 2.1 ORGANISATIONAL LICENSE
Applicable to corporations, institutions, or governments.

Covers:
• Internal system governance  
• Organisational certification scope  
• Mark usage within defined boundaries  

Issued annually, renewable by audit only.

---

### 2.2 SYSTEM CERTIFICATION LICENSE
Applicable to specific AI, AGI, or robotic systems.

Covers:
• Single system or deployment class  
• Defined operational scope  
• Explicit responsibility attribution  

Each materially distinct system requires a separate license.

---

### 2.3 DEPLOYMENT LICENSE
Applicable to live production deployments.

Covers:
• Runtime enforcement  
• Continuous compliance monitoring  
• Incident-based audit triggers  

Deployment licenses scale with exposure and jurisdictional footprint.

---

### 2.4 MARK USAGE LICENSE
Governs the right to display, reference, or claim TruthSeal™ certification.

Includes:
• Marketing usage rules  
• Technical documentation references  
• Investor or regulatory disclosures  

Unauthorized mark usage constitutes immediate breach.

---

## 3. PRICING TIERS (INDICATIVE)

Pricing is determined by risk profile, not system size.

Indicative bands:

• Research / Prototype Systems: Low six figures (USD)  
• Commercial AI Systems: Mid six to low seven figures (USD)  
• AGI / Robotics Deployments: High seven to eight figures (USD)  
• Sovereign / National Systems: Negotiated treaty pricing  

Final pricing is set exclusively by TruthSeal™ authority.

---

## 4. AUDIT & RENEWAL FEES

Audits are not bundled “support services.”

Audit fees apply to:

• Initial certification  
• Periodic re-audit  
• Incident-triggered audit  
• Unscheduled compliance inspections  

Audit refusal voids certification immediately.

---

## 5. REVENUE STREAMS

TruthSeal™ revenue derives from:

• Certification issuance  
• Licensing renewals  
• Audit execution  
• Mark usage rights  
• Advisory services (non-certifying)  

No revenue is derived from:
• Data resale  
• Model training  
• Surveillance  
• Compute metering  

---

## 6. COMMERCIAL EXCLUSIVITY

TruthSeal™ retains absolute discretion over:

• Client selection  
• Jurisdictional availability  
• Sector participation  
• Strategic partnerships  

TruthSeal™ may refuse service without justification.

---

## 7. PROHIBITED COMMERCIAL PRACTICES

The following are strictly prohibited:

• Reselling certification  
• White-label governance  
• Third-party sublicensing  
• Certification-as-a-service platforms  
• Automated or API-issued certifications  

Violations result in permanent exclusion.

---

## 8. PAYMENT & ENFORCEMENT

All fees are payable in advance unless otherwise agreed.

Non-payment results in:
• Immediate suspension  
• Public revocation notice  
• Mark usage termination  

Financial disputes do not suspend governance enforcement.

---

## 9. FUTURE COMMERCIAL EVOLUTION

TruthSeal™ reserves the right to introduce:

• Treaty-based sovereign agreements  
• Multilateral certification regimes  
• Hardware-embedded governance pricing  
• Insurance-linked compliance instruments  

All future models remain bound to this commercial doctrine.

---

## 10. FINAL COMMERCIAL AUTHORITY

This document constitutes the final authority on TruthSeal™ commercial operations.

No external pricing framework, contract, or agreement may override its provisions.
