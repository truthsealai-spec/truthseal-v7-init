# TruthSeal™ Deployment & Integration Requirements

## PREAMBLE — OPERATIONAL AUTHORITY

This document defines the mandatory technical, architectural, and operational conditions under which TruthSeal™ may be deployed, integrated, or embedded within any system.

TruthSeal™ is not a software feature.
It is a **governance enforcement layer**.

Any deployment outside these requirements constitutes unauthorized operation.

---

## 1. PERMITTED DEPLOYMENT CONTEXTS

TruthSeal™ may be deployed only within:

• Artificial Intelligence systems  
• Artificial General Intelligence systems  
• Robotics and autonomous systems  
• Governance middleware and control planes  
• Compliance, audit, or safety enforcement layers  

Standalone, decorative, or symbolic deployments are prohibited.

---

## 2. INTEGRATION POSITIONING

TruthSeal™ must be integrated at one or more of the following layers:

• Decision boundary layer  
• Policy enforcement layer  
• Audit and receipt generation layer  
• Control escalation or kill-switch layer  
• Governance orchestration layer  

TruthSeal™ must not be bypassable by application logic.

---

## 3. ARCHITECTURAL SEPARATION

Certified deployments must ensure:

• Logical separation from core model weights  
• Isolation from self-modifying code paths  
• Independence from business logic overrides  
• Protected execution boundaries  

TruthSeal™ must remain sovereign to the system it governs.

---

## 4. DECISION INTERCEPTION REQUIREMENTS

All certified systems must route the following through TruthSeal™:

• Irreversible decisions  
• High-risk actions  
• Escalation events  
• External actuation commands  
• Legal, safety, or ethical boundary crossings  

Non-intercepted execution invalidates certification.

---

## 5. RECEIPT & TRACEABILITY OBLIGATIONS

Deployments must support:

• Deterministic decision receipts  
• Immutable execution records  
• Time-ordered audit trails  
• Cryptographic integrity verification  

Receipt suppression or modification is prohibited.

---

## 6. RUNTIME INTEGRITY CONDITIONS

At runtime, TruthSeal™ must:

• Remain continuously active  
• Be tamper-resistant  
• Detect integrity violations  
• Enforce halt or escalation on breach  

Fail-open behavior is not permitted.

---

## 7. UPDATE & CHANGE MANAGEMENT

Any of the following require re-certification:

• Model updates  
• Policy changes  
• Architecture changes  
• Deployment environment changes  
• Integration scope expansion  

Unreported changes void certification immediately.

---

## 8. CLOUD, EDGE, & DISTRIBUTED DEPLOYMENTS

For non-centralized deployments:

• Governance authority must remain unified  
• Receipts must converge to a single audit domain  
• Local instances may not self-certify  
• Offline operation must fail safely  

Fragmented governance is prohibited.

---

## 9. THIRD-PARTY DEPENDENCIES

Certified systems must:

• Declare all third-party dependencies  
• Ensure no dependency can bypass TruthSeal™  
• Prevent delegated authority leakage  

Third-party autonomy over governance is forbidden.

---

## 10. HUMAN OVERRIDE & ESCALATION

Deployments must support:

• Human emergency override  
• Manual intervention pathways  
• Escalation to designated authorities  

However, overrides must themselves be receipted and auditable.

---

## 11. DECOMMISSIONING & TERMINATION

Upon decommissioning:

• TruthSeal™ must be cleanly detached  
• Final audit receipts must be generated  
• Mark usage must cease  

Silent removal is prohibited.

---

## 12. FINAL AUTHORITY

This document is the final authority governing TruthSeal™ deployment and integration.

No engineering, commercial, or operational convenience overrides these requirements.
