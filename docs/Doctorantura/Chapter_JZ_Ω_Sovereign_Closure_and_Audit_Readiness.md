**TRUTHSEAL™ DOCTORANTURA — THE SOVEREIGN ARC OF AGI FRAMEWORK v1.0**

**Ω — Sovereign Closure, Audit Readiness, and Irreversibility Seal**

**Author: Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)
Role: Founder & Chief Architect
TruthSeal™ Document Class: Doctorantura Edition — Internal Canonical
Canonical Law Jurisdiction: TruthSeal™
Sovereign Framework Law Status: Active / Binding**

**This Omega Section constitutes the formal closure of the Sovereign Arc as defined herein and establishes the system’s irreversible readiness for audit, enforcement continuity, and custodial operation. With Ω enacted, all preceding chapters are elevated from doctrine and design into binding operational law.**

Ω affirms that every cognitive pathway, enforcement gate, ledger entry, and terminal safeguard defined across Chapters A–J operates under a single invariant: no authority exists without verifiable truth. Any deviation detected post-closure is not a flaw to be debated, but a breach to be contained.

From this point forward, TruthSeal™ operates in Audit-First Mode. All actions, denials, escalations, appeals, and terminations are required to produce ledger-anchored receipts compatible with EVL™ replay and independent sovereign verification.

Ω further declares Irreversibility of Canon. No retroactive modification, reinterpretation, or dilution of doctrine is permitted without an explicit Sovereign Amendment anchored as a new epoch. Silent edits, probabilistic relaxations, or downstream overrides are constitutionally invalid.

This closure also marks the formal handoff from construction to custodianship. Development continues only within the boundaries of compliance, never in contradiction to canon. The system may evolve, but the law does not drift.

With Ω sealed, TruthSeal™ stands as a complete, auditable, and enforceable sovereign framework. The Arc is closed. The record is immutable. Authority is now computable.
