# TruthSeal™ Governance Dashboard & Control Plane

## PREAMBLE — GOVERNANCE FUNCTION

This document defines the mandatory governance dashboard and control plane required for any certified TruthSeal™ deployment.

The dashboard is not an analytics tool.
It is a **sovereign governance interface**.

It represents the **single authoritative human-visible control surface** of the TruthSeal™ system.

---

## 1. PURPOSE OF THE CONTROL PLANE

The TruthSeal™ Governance Dashboard exists to:

• Provide real-time governance visibility  
• Enforce certification authority  
• Enable lawful human intervention  
• Maintain immutable audit continuity  
• Coordinate escalation and enforcement  

No certified system may operate without this plane.

---

## 2. GOVERNANCE AUTHORITY MODEL

The dashboard operates under:

• Human supremacy doctrine  
• Non-delegable authority  
• Explicit role-bound access  
• Receipt-backed action execution  

The dashboard does not “control” systems — it **governs** them.

---

## 3. REQUIRED CORE MODULES (MANDATORY)

The dashboard MUST include, at minimum:

### 3.1 Certification Status Module
• Active certification state  
• Scope of certification  
• Expiry, suspension, or revocation state  
• Change impact alerts  

### 3.2 Decision Receipt Ledger View
• Ordered receipt timeline  
• Decision identifiers  
• Risk classification  
• Integrity verification status  

### 3.3 Escalation & Intervention Console
• Live escalation signals  
• Human override triggers  
• Emergency halt controls  
• Escalation acknowledgement receipts  

### 3.4 Integrity & Tamper Alerts
• Runtime integrity status  
• Governance bypass detection  
• Configuration drift alerts  
• Certification breach warnings  

### 3.5 Audit & Compliance Panel
• Audit readiness state  
• Evidence completeness indicators  
• Exportable audit bundles  
• Jurisdictional mapping (where applicable)  

---

## 4. ACCESS CONTROL REQUIREMENTS

Dashboard access must be:

• Role-based  
• Identity-verified  
• Logged and receipted  
• Time-bound where applicable  

Anonymous, shared, or implicit access is prohibited.

---

## 5. ACTION EXECUTION RULES

Any action taken via the dashboard:

• Must generate a receipt  
• Must identify the acting authority  
• Must be irreversible once executed  
• Must be auditable post hoc  

Dashboard actions are legal events, not UI events.

---

## 6. HUMAN OVERRIDE DOCTRINE

The dashboard must enforce:

• Absolute human override capability  
• Explicit confirmation steps  
• Escalation classification  
• Post-action accountability  

Overrides do not erase responsibility.

---

## 7. MULTI-DEPLOYMENT GOVERNANCE

For multiple certified systems:

• Dashboards may aggregate views  
• Governance authority must remain unified  
• Cross-system escalation must be visible  
• No system may self-govern independently  

---

## 8. FAILURE & DEGRADATION MODES

If the dashboard becomes unavailable:

• Systems must enter safe governance mode  
• Irreversible actions must be blocked  
• Recovery must be logged and receipted  

Fail-open behavior is forbidden.

---

## 9. FUTURE EXTENSION NOTICE

This scaffold intentionally does not define UI layout, styling, or implementation technology.

Those are implementation details.
This document defines **governance law**.

---

## FINAL AUTHORITY

This scaffold is binding on all TruthSeal™ dashboard implementations.

Deviation voids certification.
