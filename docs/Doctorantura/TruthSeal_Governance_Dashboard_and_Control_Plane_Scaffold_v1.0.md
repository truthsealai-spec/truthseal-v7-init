# TruthSeal™ Governance Dashboard & Control Plane

Subtitle: Doctorantura Definition of the Mandatory Human Governance Interface for Certified Artificial Intelligence, Artificial General Intelligence, and Robotic Systems

---

## PREAMBLE — GOVERNANCE FUNCTION

This document defines the mandatory governance dashboard and control plane required for **any certified TruthSeal™ deployment of a Governed System** under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework.

The dashboard is **not an analytics tool**.  
It is **not an operational control console**.  

It is a **sovereign governance interface** through which legally empowered humans exercise governance authority **over certified artificial intelligence, artificial general intelligence, and robotic systems**.

The dashboard represents the **single authoritative, human-visible governance surface** of the TruthSeal™ framework for all certified systems.

No certified system may operate without an active and compliant governance control plane.

---

## 0. SCOPE & REFERENT DEFINITIONS

### 0.1 Governed Systems

“Governed Systems” refers to any artificial intelligence system, artificial general intelligence system, robotic system, autonomous agent, hybrid human–machine system, or decision automation platform that is:

• Certified under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework; or  
• Operating under an active TruthSeal™ certification lifecycle; or  
• Claiming TruthSeal™ compliance, auditability, certification, or mark usage.  

### 0.2 Governance Dashboard & Control Plane

The “TruthSeal™ Governance Dashboard & Control Plane” refers to the authoritative human-facing governance interface through which:

• Certification state is observed and enforced  
• Decision receipts are reviewed and validated  
• Escalations, overrides, and halts are executed  
• Audit evidence is accessed and exported  
• Governance authority is exercised by humans  

The dashboard does **not** execute tasks or commands within Governed Systems.  
It governs **authority, legality, certification, and accountability**, not behavior.

### 0.3 Human Authorities

“Human Authorities” refers exclusively to identified, authenticated, and role-authorized human persons or institutions legally empowered to exercise governance actions under the TruthSeal™ framework.

No artificial system, autonomous agent, or delegated algorithm may qualify as a Human Authority.

### 0.4 Governance Actions

“Governance Actions” include, but are not limited to:

• Certification issuance, suspension, or revocation  
• Escalation acknowledgment or enforcement  
• Emergency intervention or halt  
• Override authorization  
• Audit confirmation or non-compliance declaration  

All Governance Actions are **legally consequential acts**.

### 0.5 Governance Visibility

“Governance Visibility” refers to real-time and historical visibility provided **to Human Authorities** over the state, integrity, compliance posture, and certification status of Governed Systems.

Visibility does not imply operational control.

---

## 1. PURPOSE OF THE CONTROL PLANE

The TruthSeal™ Governance Dashboard exists to:

• Provide Human Authorities with real-time governance visibility **over Governed Systems**  
• Enforce certification authority **over certified Governed Systems**  
• Enable lawful human intervention **into Governed Systems**  
• Maintain immutable audit continuity **for all governance actions affecting Governed Systems**  
• Coordinate escalation and enforcement **across multiple Governed Systems and deployments**  

No certified system may operate outside this governance plane.

---

## 2. GOVERNANCE AUTHORITY MODEL

The dashboard operates under the following non-negotiable principles:

• Absolute human supremacy  
• Non-delegable governance authority  
• Explicit role-bound access  
• Receipt-backed action execution  

The dashboard does not “control” systems — it **governs authority, legality, and accountability** over them.

---

## 3. REQUIRED CORE MODULES (MANDATORY)

Every TruthSeal™ Governance Dashboard MUST include the following modules:

### 3.1 Certification Status Module

• Active certification state  
• Scope of certification coverage  
• Expiry, suspension, or revocation state  
• Change impact alerts affecting certification validity  

### 3.2 Decision Receipt Ledger View

• Ordered receipt timeline  
• Decision and action identifiers  
• Risk classification and escalation tier  
• Integrity and verification status  

### 3.3 Escalation & Intervention Console

• Live escalation signals from Governed Systems  
• Human override triggers  
• Emergency halt controls  
• Escalation acknowledgment and receipt issuance  

### 3.4 Integrity & Tamper Alerts

• Runtime integrity status of Governed Systems  
• Governance bypass detection  
• Configuration drift alerts  
• Certification breach warnings  

### 3.5 Audit & Compliance Panel

• Audit readiness state  
• Evidence completeness indicators  
• Exportable audit bundles  
• Jurisdictional and regulatory mapping where applicable  

---

## 4. ACCESS CONTROL REQUIREMENTS

Dashboard access MUST be:

• Role-based  
• Identity-verified  
• Logged and receipted  
• Time-bound where applicable  

Anonymous, shared, inherited, or implicit access is strictly prohibited.

---

## 5. ACTION EXECUTION RULES

Any action taken via the dashboard:

• Must generate a cryptographic receipt  
• Must identify the acting Human Authority  
• Must be irreversible once executed  
• Must remain auditable post hoc  

Dashboard actions are **legal governance events**, not user-interface interactions.

---

## 6. HUMAN OVERRIDE DOCTRINE

The dashboard MUST enforce:

• Absolute human override capability  
• Explicit confirmation steps  
• Escalation classification  
• Post-action accountability  

Overrides do not erase responsibility.

---

## 7. MULTI-DEPLOYMENT GOVERNANCE

For multiple certified Governed Systems:

• Dashboards may aggregate governance views  
• Governance authority must remain unified  
• Cross-system escalation must be visible  
• No system may self-govern independently  

---

## 8. FAILURE & DEGRADATION MODES

If the dashboard becomes unavailable:

• Governed Systems must enter safe governance mode  
• Irreversible actions must be blocked  
• Recovery must be logged and receipted  

Fail-open behavior is forbidden.

---

## 9. FUTURE EXTENSION NOTICE

This document intentionally does not define UI layout, styling, or implementation technology.

Those are implementation details.

This document defines **governance law**.

---

## FINAL AUTHORITY

This scaffold is binding on all TruthSeal™ governance dashboard implementations governing Governed Systems.

Deviation voids certification.
