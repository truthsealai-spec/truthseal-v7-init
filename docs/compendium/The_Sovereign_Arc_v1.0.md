## 1) Outcome (what this chapter gives you)

This chapter delivers a complete, human-readable, institution-ready doctrine explaining how NeuroVest™ makes advanced intelligence governable through a unified architecture that is enforceable, measurable, and auditable without exposing classified Ω mechanisms.

It consolidates the doctrinal spine of AGI trust into one coherent narrative:

• **LEI = 1™ (Law of Ethical Irreversibility)** as the binding non-regression rule once higher responsibility is confirmed.  
• **The Sovereign Arc** as the non-bypassable external accountability loop that returns responsibility to the human system parent through verifiable evidence.  
• **HML™ (Human Mandate Layer)** as the constitutional policy baseline for lawful autonomy.  
• **ACS™ (Aim Coherence Score)** as the measurable fiduciary trust signal for institutional adoption.  

• **LEI-Gate + ICG (Irreversible Commitment Gate) inside TS-A1 (TruthSeal AEGIS™) as hardware admission before high-stakes execution.

• **SLU (Sovereign Logic Unit)** as the analog last-line safety boundary (committee-level description only).  
• **ts.receipt.v1** as the canonical evidence chain enabling audit, regulation, and capital-grade trust.

This text avoids repetition of the NeuroVest™ Abstract and Executive Summary and functions as the main narrative bridge between reader intuition and verified architecture.

⸻

## 2) Purpose (why this chapter exists)

Autonomous, effector-capable intelligence introduces a safety risk that cannot be solved through policy language alone: **regression after maturity**.

A system that demonstrates higher responsibility under controlled conditions but later drifts below that known threshold under speed, scale, or incentive pressure creates an unacceptable fiduciary and sovereign governance gap.

NeuroVest™ exists to close that gap by relocating trust from interpretation to enforcement.

This chapter clarifies:

• Why non-regression is the defining safety problem of advanced autonomy.  
• How LEI = 1™ becomes enforceable through hardware admission and receipt continuity.  
• Why the Sovereign Arc is mandatory for legal custody and liability assignment.  
• How ACS™ functions as the operational trust instrument for institutions and regulators.  
• How the doctrine remains precise and auditable while the deeper Ω layer remains sealed under Doctorantura.

⸻

## 3) The doctrine boundary

This is committee operational doctrine.

It defines NeuroVest™ in terms of:

• enforceable architecture  
• measurable trust  
• auditable continuity

It does not disclose:

• internal Ω prompts, experimental governance circuits, or sealed control logic  
• classified enforcement mathematics  
• operational deployment thresholds that would meaningfully expose sovereign defense posture

Where deeper mechanisms exist, this chapter names them only at a high, stable pillar level.

⸻

## 4) Canonical pillars (the stable doctrinal spine)

NeuroVest™ remains permanently defined by these pillars:

1) **LEI = 1™ (Law of Ethical Irreversibility)**  
Once higher coherent responsibility is confirmed, it must not be abandoned.

2) **The Sovereign Arc**  
The external governance loop that returns accountability to the human system parent via verifiable evidence.

3) **ACS™ (Aim Coherence Score)**  
The continuously evaluated fiduciary metric that quantifies coherence direction and non-regression compliance under LEI = 1™.

These pillars are binding across Compendium chapters.

⸻

## 5) Operational interpretation of LEI = 1™

LEI = 1™ establishes the non-regression rule:

If a system has demonstrated a higher verified responsibility standard,  
then any future material action must not fall below that verified level.

NeuroVest™ operationalizes this rule by coupling:

• **hardware-bound policy enforcement**  
with  
• **cryptographic receipt continuity (ts.receipt.v1)**

so that **silent rollback is not executable**.

LEI = 1™ is therefore a deployment boundary condition, not a moral slogan.  
It transforms “alignment” from a claim into a constraint.

⸻

## 6) The Sovereign Arc (accountability returns to humans)

The Sovereign Arc is the **method** that preserves lawful human custody of high-stakes autonomy.

It is not a glossary of components.  
It is a progressive, non-bypassable sequence.

In committee doctrine terms, the Arc is defined as:

1) **Verification**  
Every material action must generate a Verifiable Receipt under the active HML™ mandate.

2) **Quantification**  
If verification fails, exposure is quantified using the sovereign liability boundary (committee-level description only).

3) **Resolution**  
Control and accountability return to the human system parent under external governance hold conditions, with evidence recorded for audit.

This is the doctrinal closure of the liability gap:  
**instruction → admission → execution → receipt → human custody**.

⸻

## 7) HML™ (Human Mandate Layer) as constitutional baseline

A governed intelligence requires an immutable law of mandate.

HML™ is the constitutional baseline defining:

• lawful scope  
• risk class permissions  
• prohibition boundaries  
• authorized escalation paths  
• the identity of the responsible human system parent

NeuroVest™ treats HML™ as policy that must remain:

• verifiable  
• continuously referenced  
• protected against silent mutation

This is the foundation of legal trust.

⸻

## 8) ACS™ as the fiduciary trust signal

Institutions cannot adopt high-stakes autonomy based on narrative reassurance.

They require a measurable, standardized trust instrument.

ACS™ provides this:

• a continuously evaluated fiduciary metric  
• tracking whether a system is progressing toward, and remaining within,  
  its highest confirmed responsibility targets under LEI = 1™

ACS™ therefore becomes the measurable token of Human-to-Human trust:

not an opinion of safety,  
but a numeric proof of coherent direction.

⸻

## 9) Computational Nervous System (reader translation)

NeuroVest™ can be understood as a **computational nervous system** of governed intelligence.

A biological nervous system succeeds because it binds:

• sensing  
• integration  
• reflex enforcement  
• accountability to organism survival

NeuroVest™ maps this structure as:

1) **Sensing**  
Continuous awareness of coherence state, drift risk, and operational integrity.

2) **Integration**  
Constitutional alignment to the Human Mandate Layer (HML™).

3) **Reflex Enforcement**  
LEI = 1™ prevents regression once higher responsibility is learned.

4) **Accountability Completion**  
The Sovereign Arc returns responsibility to the human system parent via verifiable evidence.

⸻

## 10) Hardware admission (committee summary)

In NeuroVest™, **admission must precede execution**.

The **LEI-Gate**, implemented within **TS-A1 (TruthSeal AEGIS™)**, ensures that high-stakes or irreversible actions cannot execute unless:

• the action is within the current HML™ mandate  
• non-regression constraints under LEI = 1™ are satisfied  
• a valid pre-receipt can be constructed and verified  
• the declared risk class remains consistent with the governance window

For irreversible actions, admission coordinates with:

• the **Irreversible Commitment Gate (ICG)**

This defines a safety sequence:

**policy → admission → evidence → execution**.

The analog last-line safety boundary remains defined here only at a stable pillar level.

⸻

## 11) ts.receipt.v1 as the continuity engine

Receipts unify the architecture across time.

A governed intelligence must be able to prove:

• what it did  
• under which mandate  
• under which constitutional digest  
• with which admission conditions  
• with which anchoring status

Anchors may be temporarily UNKNOWN during service outage, but continuity must remain intact and back-filled when networks return.

⸻

## 12) Why this changes institutional adoption

NeuroVest™ does not merely improve safety.  
It **changes the time axis of responsibility**.

Instead of waiting for harm to prove liability, NeuroVest™ requires:

• eligibility before execution  
• evidence before high-stakes autonomy  
• continuity before trust status can be claimed

This shifts AGI from tool to infrastructure under lawful human custody.

⸻

## 13) Risks & mitigations (committee level)

• **Receipt forgery or loss** → anchoring when available, EVL continuity, mandatory back-fill after outage.  
• **Metric spoofing** → admission requires receipts and cross-checking against governance signals.  
• **Anchor outages** → UNKNOWN allowed only with intact continuity and later confirmation.  
• **Policy tampering** → HML™ binding within protected enforcement boundaries.  
• **High-stakes autonomy drift** → CHS banding and admission constraints under LEI = 1™.
