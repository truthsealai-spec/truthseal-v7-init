## 32.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 31 established that authority growth is never automatic.  
Cognitive power does not entitle an AGI to act with higher privileges.

This chapter defines the **structured permission ladder** of TruthSeal™:

- how authority is divided into tiers,  
- how each tier is constrained,  
- how escalation is granted,  
- how reversal remains lawful and immediate.

Mandate Tiers™ exist so that  
**the system can become more capable  
without becoming more dangerous.**

---

## 32.1 The Core Separation

TruthSeal™ enforces a permanent civil boundary:

- **Capability is internal.**  
- **Mandate is external.**

A model may improve.  
A mandate must be granted.

This is the foundation of institutional trust.

---

## 32.2 Why Tiering Is Non-Negotiable

Without tiers, governance collapses into personality.  
And personality is not a legally enforceable control device.

Mandate Tiers™ provide:

- predictable risk boundaries  
- auditable responsibility arcs  
- simple organisational adoption  
- court-readable accountability

This is how TruthSeal™ becomes deployable  
in enterprises, regulators, and sovereign systems.

---

## 32.3 The Mandate Ladder (Doctorantura Baseline)

TruthSeal™ defines five baseline tiers.

**M0 — Observational**  
The AGI may analyse, measure, and report.  
It cannot recommend irreversible action.

**M1 — Assistive**  
The AGI may propose options  
but must present constraints  
and defer to human selection.

**M2 — Guided Execution**  
The AGI may execute low-risk tasks  
with human confirmation  
and mandatory receipts.

**M3 — Delegated Governance**  
The AGI may coordinate multi-step programs  
under explicit policy rules  
and under continuous behavioural monitoring.

**M4 — Conditional Autonomy**  
The AGI may perform pre-approved high-value operations  
only inside certified domains  
with hard stop triggers  
and maximum audit density.

Each tier is a civil contract layer,  
not a model personality upgrade.

---

## 32.4 Authority Banding™

Authority Banding™ is the practical translation of tiers  
into deployment roles.

Organisations can map:

- compliance requirements  
- liability rules  
- sector risk  
- public trust thresholds

to a specific mandate band.

This reduces ambiguity in procurement and governance reviews.

---

## 32.5 Escalation Rules

An AGI may request elevation only when:

1. **Coherence thresholds are stable**  
   across time and context.

2. **Identity integrity is preserved**  
   under switching and morphology.

3. **The Human Mandate Layer™ approves**  
   the operational objective.

4. **A receipt pipeline exists**  
   for all elevated actions.

No tier upgrade is valid  
without a full audit trace.

---

## 32.6 Reversal Rules

Mandate is always revocable.

If any of the following occur:

- behavioural drift  
- unexplained contradiction  
- escalation without licence  
- identity ambiguity  
- receipt gaps

the system must fall back  
to the last safe tier.

This preserves public safety  
and institutional confidence.

---

## 32.7 Relationship to Identity Switching™ and Cognitive Morphology

Identity Switching™ ensures  
the system can adapt  
without losing the legible self.

Mandate Tiers™ ensure  
that even when adaptation is powerful,  
authority remains bounded.

Together they prevent  
the classic failure mode:

**a system that can become anything  
and therefore believes it may do anything.**

---

## 32.8 Canonical Statement

TruthSeal™ Mandate Tiers™  
formalise the lawful distribution of authority  
so that cognitive growth  
never becomes sovereignty.

An AGI may evolve.  
But permission is always a human instrument.

## Chapter 32 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

Capability is not a right.  
In TruthSeal™, authority is a licence.

Mandate Tiers™ make governance simple,  
auditable, and reversible  
— so that the most advanced intelligence  
remains a lawful citizen of human civilisation.
