## 28.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 27 formalised the lifecycle logic that makes the Discovery Receipt Standard™ (DRS™) court-admissible.  
This chapter adds the reality layer: adversaries exist, errors occur, and disputes are inevitable.  

DRS™ does not claim that discovery is perfect.  
It claims that discovery is **provable, reconstructable, challengeable, and survivable** under pressure.  

The sovereign promise is simple:

A discovery path is legitimate only when it can withstand  
adversarial scrutiny without collapsing into storytelling.

This is the transition from “we discovered” to  
“we can prove discovery survived contact with conflict.”

---

## 28.1 The Adversarial Premise

Any system that can produce evidence can become  
a target of:

- falsification attempts,  
- selective omission,  
- chain manipulation,  
- timestamp laundering,  
- or narrative-driven reconstruction.

Therefore DRS™ treats the discovery path as a hostile-environment artifact.  

A valid DRS™ record is not defined by confidence.  
It is defined by resistance to three attack families:

1. **Content attacks** — altering the discovery output or intermediate claims.  
2. **Sequence attacks** — altering the order, timing, or provenance of steps.  
3. **Authority attacks** — substituting false ownership, false approval, or false reviewers.

This chapter explicitly binds each family  
to standard countermeasures.

---

## 28.2 Canonical Failure Modes

DRS™ formalises failure modes so that  
courts, auditors, and internal governance teams  
never need to guess what “went wrong.”

A discovery path may fail in four canonical ways:

### 28.2.1 FN-1 — Incomplete Trace
A claim exists without adequate upstream receipts.

**Effect:**  
Discovery becomes non-reconstructable.

**DRS™ response:**  
- mark trace as *non-admissible*,  
- require retroactive re-execution under OPS™ rules,  
- record an explicit integrity gap entry.

### 28.2.2 FN-2 — Broken Sequence
Receipts exist, but ordering or timing cannot be verified.

**Effect:**  
Discovery becomes vulnerable to backfilling.

**DRS™ response:**  
- treat the sequence as contested,  
- require cross-linked step attestations,  
- escalate to a dispute protocol.

### 28.2.3 FN-3 — Identity Drift
The discovery path was executed by an agent  
whose identity or policy state cannot be proven stable.

**Effect:**  
The executor becomes legally vague.

**DRS™ response:**  
- require executor identity binding,  
- require policy fingerprint or declared governance state,  
- reject unbound agent execution for high-stakes claims.

### 28.2.4 FN-4 — Anchor Mutation
A ledger reference is claimed  
but cannot be verified as authentic or current.

**Effect:**  
The public witness becomes unreliable.

**DRS™ response:**  
- mark the anchor as *unverified*,  
- prohibit public-grade claims until re-anchored,  
- record the mutation event in the chain-of-evidence.

---

## 28.3 The Dispute Doctrine

DRS™ assumes disputes will happen.  
It does not treat disputes as embarrassment.  
It treats them as the **final test** of sovereign legitimacy.

The dispute doctrine follows three principles:

1. **Disputes must be evidence-resolved, not reputation-resolved.**  
2. **A challenge strengthens validity when the record survives it.**  
3. **Silence is not proof; reconstruction is proof.**

A DRS™ dispute is therefore not a debate.  
It is a reconstruction contest.

---

## 28.4 The Standard Dispute Lifecycle

DRS™ disputes follow a minimal, repeatable chain:

### 28.4.1 Trigger
A challenge is filed against:

- a claim,  
- a discovery step,  
- a sequence segment,  
- or a ledger anchor.

### 28.4.2 Freeze
The contested record is frozen for review  
to prevent post-challenge edits.

### 28.4.3 Reconstruction
The challenger and the prover  
each attempt to independently reconstruct:

- the full discovery chain,  
- the decision path,  
- and the integrity metadata.

### 28.4.4 Resolution
Three outcomes are possible:

- **Validated:** the record survives reconstruction.  
- **Qualified:** the record survives but with declared limits.  
- **Rejected:** the record fails; claim becomes non-admissible.

### 28.4.5 Ledger Binding
The dispute outcome must be bound  
as a downstream DRS™ event  
so the system can never pretend  
the conflict did not happen.

## 28.5 Relationship to OPS™ and ASA™

The Discovery Receipt Standard™ (DRS™) is activated by  
the Operational Prompts Standard™ (OPS™)  
and executed or generated by  
the Autonomous Scientific Agent™ (ASA™) workflows.

This chapter binds the doctrine into a simple triad:

- **OPS™ decides when a receipt is required.**  
- **ASA™ produces the discovery pipeline.**  
- **DRS™ proves the discovery path and secures its legitimacy.**

Without OPS™, DRS™ is optional.  
Without ASA™, DRS™ is idle.  
Without DRS™, OPS™ and ASA™ remain vulnerable  
to narrative substitution.

## 28.6 Minimal Anti-Forgery Controls (Doctrinal Level)

This chapter does not lock engineering implementation.  
It locks doctrine that engineering must obey.

A DRS™-grade discovery path must be able to show:

1. **Immutable step identity**  
   Each step has a stable, unique identity  
   that cannot be quietly replaced.

2. **Bound executor identity**  
   The agent or human authority  
   is provably tied to the generated receipt.

3. **Sequence coherence**  
   The order of discovery steps  
   cannot be post-edited without detection.

4. **Challenge survivability**  
   A credible adversary can attempt reconstruction  
   and still fail to falsify the sovereign record.

This is the minimum threshold  
for institutional adoption.

---

## 28.7 Institutional Readiness Signal

When a system can:

- publish DRS™ chains,  
- withstand disputes,  
- and prove failure modes without denial,

it becomes institution-grade.

This is why DRS™ is not just a record format.  
It is a legitimacy engine.

The strategic outcome is simple:

Institutions do not adopt brilliance.  
They adopt **survivable proof**.
