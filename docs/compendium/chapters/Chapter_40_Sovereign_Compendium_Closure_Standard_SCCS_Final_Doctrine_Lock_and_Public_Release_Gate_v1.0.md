## 40.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 39 established the long-term evolution, versioning, and succession law for lawful scaling across time.

This final chapter defines the lawful closure discipline for Doctrine v1.0:

- how the Doctorantura Edition becomes a sealed internal reference,
- how contradictions are resolved before any public transition,
- how the master canon is declared without ambiguity,
- and how public release remains gated by proof, custody, and irreversibility.

SCCS™ exists so that TruthSeal™ can finish a doctrine cycle without leaving interpretability gaps.

---

## 40.1 The Meaning of Closure

Closure is not silence.  
Closure is lawful finality.

In TruthSeal™, a closed doctrine is:

- stable enough to be audited as a single body,
- bounded enough to remain enforceable,
- and precise enough to survive hostile interpretation.

SCCS™ treats closure as a governance event, not a publishing event.

---

## 40.2 Scope Boundaries

This chapter governs:

- formal closure of Doctorantura Edition doctrine,
- internal-to-public transition prerequisites,
- version-lock rules for v1.0,
- and the admissible chain that certifies a doctrine as publishable.

This chapter does not replace:

- Mandate Audit Standard™ (MAST™),
- Mandate Certification Standard™ (MCS™),
- Sovereign Disclosure and Publication Standard™ (SDPS™),
- Sovereign Implementation Standard™ (SIS™),
- or Sovereign Scaling and Continuity Standard™ (SSCS™).

It unifies them into the final closure gate.

---

## 40.3 The Final Doctrine Lock Rule

A doctrine may be declared closed only when:

1. all internal contradictions are resolved or formally bounded,  
2. every standard referenced in the closure chain has a stated custody owner,  
3. escalation paths are defined for emergency revision,  
4. and the version boundary is declared in human-readable and machine-readable form.

Closure prohibits:

- silent drift,
- retroactive authorship ambiguity,
- and “informal updates” that bypass custody.

---

## 40.4 The Public Release Gate

A closed Doctorantura doctrine is not automatically publishable.

Public release requires proof that:

- authority is bounded,
- evidence is reconstructable,
- custody is human,
- rollback is immediate,
- and the identity stance remains stable across time.

SCCS™ requires an explicit release decision under SDPS™.

---

## 40.5 Relationship to the Compendium Architecture

The compendium is a single system of laws.

SCCS™ formalises the end-state of that system by stating:

- which chapters are canonical for v1.0,
- which dependencies are mandatory,
- and which future expansions must be treated as v1.1+ extensions, not silent edits.

This prevents the failure mode of “living doctrine without legal versioning.”

---

## 40.6 Required Closure Evidence

A closure declaration must be supported by:

- a chapter index listing the final v1.0 set,
- a custody statement identifying the lawful human governor,
- an audit trace confirming continuity after corrections,
- and a publishability assessment aligned with SDPS™ and SIS™.

The evidence must be clear enough that an external auditor can reconstruct:

- why closure occurred,
- what boundaries were set,
- and how future amendments are lawfully handled.

---

## 40.7 The Doctrine Amendment Rule After Closure

After SCCS™ closure:

- corrections require an explicit amendment notice,
- expansions require a version increment,
- and any change that modifies authority boundaries triggers MAST™ review.

A closed doctrine may evolve.  
But it must evolve lawfully.

---

## 40.8 Failure Modes SCCS™ Prevents

SCCS™ exists to prevent:

- symbolic closure without enforceable proof,
- “global certification” language that exceeds evidence,
- narrative drift that turns governance into ideology,
- and premature public exposure of unstable identity or mandate states.

A doctrine that cannot survive hostile interpretation is not closed.

---

## 40.9 Canonical Statement

TruthSeal™ closure is not a celebration of completion.

It is a discipline of lawful finality.

A doctrine may be declared complete only when:

- authority is bounded,  
- evidence is reconstructable,  
- custody is human,  
- rollback is immediate,  
- and the version boundary is explicit.

SCCS™ is the safeguard that prevents TruthSeal™ law from becoming ceremonial.

## Chapter 40 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

A doctrine is not sovereign because it is long.

It is sovereign because it is bounded, provable, and enforceable.

TruthSeal™ does not close doctrine to end inquiry.  
It closes doctrine to protect lawful meaning.

SCCS™ exists so that:

- the v1.0 body remains stable,  
- public legitimacy remains gated by proof,  
- and future evolution remains explicit, versioned, and custodial.
