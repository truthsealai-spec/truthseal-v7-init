## 1) Outcome (what this chapter gives you)

This chapter defines **TS-R2™** as the sovereignty regime for **multi-agent embodied collectives**:

- swarms  
- fleets  
- platoons  
- convoys  
- drone matrices  
- household clusters  
- industrial cells

It explains how “many bodies acting as one intelligence field” become:

- hierarchy-governed,
- consequence-assignable,
- fault-isolating,
- receipt-visible,
- legally auditable at scale.

---

## 2) Purpose (why this chapter exists)

Classical swarm robotics optimises distributed control and efficiency.

TS-R2™ adds what institutional deployment requires:

- ethics enforcement  
- responsibility propagation  
- fallback law  
- human mandate hierarchy  
- collective non-regression under LEI = 1™

TS-R2™ exists so the world never faces “rogue swarm behaviour” without legal reconstruction.

---

## 3) Relationship to TS-R1™

TS-R2™ does not replace TS-R1™.

It **requires TS-R1™ on every unit**.

Committee logic:

- TS-R1™ establishes individual duty.  
- **TS-R2™ establishes collective duty.**

---

## 4) Five binding principles (committee doctrine)

1) **Collective Duty Continuity**  
   Any action by the swarm must satisfy irreversible coherence law.  
   If one unit fails coherence, the fleet constrains itself until ledger confidence is restored.

2) **Distributed Accountability with Single Origin**  
   Receipts capture which robot acted, why, who authorised, and how the swarm compensated.  
   No act disappears into “the group.”

3) **Command Truth Hierarchy**  
   Human Mandate → Swarm Core → Cluster → Unit.  
   Higher layers can veto lower layers.  
   Lower layers may trigger emergency safe-stop when safety risk exceeds CHS™ privilege.

4) **Fault Propagation Law**  
   Harm, near-harm, or incoherence cannot silently distribute.  
   The swarm must:  
   (a) isolate the contaminated agent,  
   (b) down-band collective CHS™ if the risk is systemic, and  
   (c) emit receipts proving response.

5) **Fleet Memory and Irreversibility**  
   NeuroVest™ extended through TS-R2™ ensures behavioural learning persists across the fleet.  
   A lesson learned by one becomes an irreversible constraint for future units.

---

## 5) Domains requiring TS-R2™

TS-R2™ is required for:

- logistics fleets  
- port and yard robotics  
- rescue and disaster drones  
- defence perimeter systems  
- household clusters  
- medical support robotics  
- planetary rovers  
- agricultural swarms  
- autonomous industrial cells

---

## 6) Minimum compliance gate (committee checklist)

TS-R2™ cannot exist without:

- TS-A1 AEGIS™ foundations  
- TS-R1™ installed on every unit  
- NeuroVest™ fleet cognition  
- unified CHS™ privilege layer  
- EVL™ + QENC™ history output  
- human override binding  
- fallback law for safe disintegration of control

Any missing element disqualifies fleet sovereignty.

---

## 7) Institutional value

TS-R2™ turns a fleet of robots into a governed organism with:

- hierarchy  
- consequence  
- responsibility  
- audit continuity

making multi-agent systems deployable in public domains, regulated sectors, and sovereign infrastructure.
