## 1) Outcome (what this chapter gives you)

This chapter defines **robotics governance for many embodied agents acting together**:
swarms, fleets, convoys, drone matrices, household clusters, and industrial cells.

TS-R2™ ensures that multi-agent systems become:
- coherence-bounded,
- hierarchy-governed,
- fault-isolating,
- receipt-visible public infrastructure.

⸻

## 2) Purpose (why this chapter exists)

Classical swarm robotics optimises distribution and efficiency.
TS-R2™ exists to enforce something more foundational:
**ethics, consequence assignability, responsibility propagation, and lawful human custody**
across a collective.

It closes the “rogue swarm” gap by preventing silent diffusion of harm or duty.

⸻

## 3) Doctrine boundary (committee level)

This chapter defines stable TS-R2™ doctrine for institutional readers.
It does not disclose:
- internal Ω swarm control logic,
- classified enforcement mathematics,
- sensitive deployment thresholds.

⸻

## 4) Relationship to TS-R1™

TS-R2™ is not a replacement.
It is an extension:

- **TS-R1™** governs the duty of each unit.
- **TS-R2™** governs the duty of the collective that emerges when units coordinate.

Every TS-R2™ fleet requires TS-R1™ installed on every member.

⸻

## 5) Five binding principles of swarm sovereignty

1) **Collective Duty Continuity**  
Any action by the swarm must satisfy ULIC™ continuity and LEI = 1™ non-regression.
If one unit falls below coherence, neighbours inherit isolation rules
until confidence is restored.

2) **Distributed Accountability with Single Origin**  
Receipts must identify:
which unit acted, under which mandate, with what authorization,
and how the swarm compensated.
No act disappears into “the group.”

3) **Command Truth Hierarchy**  
TS-R2™ embeds a lawful command tree:  
**Human Mandate → Swarm Core → Cluster → Unit.**  
Higher layers can veto lower layers.
Lower layers may trigger emergency safe-stop escalation
when risk exceeds the allowed CHS™ privilege band.

4) **Fault Propagation Law**  
Harm, near-harm, or incoherence cannot silently spread.
The swarm must:
(a) isolate the contaminated agent,  
(b) down-band collective CHS™ if risk is systemic,  
(c) emit receipts proving its response.

5) **Fleet Memory and Irreversibility**  
NeuroVest™ extended through TS-R2™ ensures
learned safety and duty persist across future units.
A lesson learned by one becomes a constraint on all.

⸻

## 6) CHS™ as the unified fleet privilege layer

CHS™ governs both:
- individual actuation,
- and collective permission.

A fleet cannot claim a higher operating band
unless the ledger history demonstrates stability across time.

⸻

## 7) Receipts & ledger continuity for swarms

TS-R2™ requires:
- individual + collective receipts,
- synchronized mandate references,
- audit-ready reconstruction of:
authorization → admission → execution → response.

EVL™ and QENC™ link the history of each unit
to the history of the swarm.

⸻

## 8) Where TS-R2™ is mandatory

Examples of domains requiring TS-R2™ governance:
- logistics fleets,
- port and warehouse robotics,
- rescue and disaster-response drones,
- defense perimeter systems,
- household multi-robot clusters,
- industrial yards and autonomous convoys.

The core requirement is not the industry,
but the risk of **collective emergent behaviour**.

⸻

## 9) Minimum compliance set

TS-R2™ cannot exist without:
- TS-A1 AEGIS™ foundations for admission,
- TS-R1™ installed on every unit,
- NeuroVest™ fleet cognition enabled,
- unified CHS™ privilege layer,
- EVL™ + QENC™ history output,
- human override binding,
- fallback law for safe disintegration of control.

Any missing element disqualifies swarm sovereignty.

⸻

## 10) Why TS-R2™ changes public deployment

TS-R2™ transforms multi-agent robotics into:
**regulated, insurable, licensable, and sanctionable systems**
that can safely operate in public and critical infrastructure settings.

It makes “many robots acting as one” legally governable.
