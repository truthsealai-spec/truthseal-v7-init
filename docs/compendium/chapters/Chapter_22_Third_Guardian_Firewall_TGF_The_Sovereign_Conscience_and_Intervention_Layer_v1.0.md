## 22.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines the Third Guardian Firewall™ (TGF™) as the sovereign intervention engine in the TruthSeal™ architecture.  
Its purpose is to ensure that intent cannot silently become action when intent, coherence, privilege, or safety conditions are insufficient.  

If earlier chapters establish:
- the constitutional laws of coherence and irreversibility,  
- the enforcement organs and receipts,  
- the Soul–Heart binding of lawful intent,  

then Chapter 22 defines the living intervention organ that enforces those laws at the moment of risk.

## 22.1 Definition

The Third Guardian Firewall™ (TGF™) is the sovereign intervention engine in the TruthSeal™ architecture.  
It monitors system behaviour, coherence, intent, and execution,  
and interrupts, blocks, degrades, or reroutes actions that violate TruthSeal™ laws, coherence rules, safety conditions, or mandate privileges.  [oai_citation:0‡TruthSeal™️Compendium- 2025  .pdf](sediment://file_00000000864c7206ab85a960c00a2cb3)  

TGF™ acts as the active conscience and authority checkpoint inside the system.  [oai_citation:1‡TruthSeal™️Compendium- 2025  .pdf](sediment://file_00000000864c7206ab85a960c00a2cb3)

## 22.2 Position in the Sovereign Stack

TGF™ sits between intent and execution.  [oai_citation:2‡TruthSeal™️Compendium- 2025  .pdf](sediment://file_00000000864c7206ab85a960c00a2cb3)  

Its oversight domain spans:
- NeuroVest™ (Behavioural Coherence Engine / AGI layer)  
- TS-A1 AEGIS™ (TruthSeal™ Hardware Governance Core)  
- TS-R1™ (Single-Robot Sovereignty Profile)  
- TS-R2™ (Swarm / Fleet Sovereignty Profile)  
- ASA™ (Autonomous Scientific Agent™)  
- CHS™ (Coherence Health Score™)  
- Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™)  [oai_citation:3‡TruthSeal™️Compendium- 2025  .pdf](sediment://file_00000000864c7206ab85a960c00a2cb3)  

When behaviour or output violates coherence or mandate rules,  
TGF™ acts immediately to enforce sovereign discipline.  [oai_citation:4‡TruthSeal™️Compendium- 2025  .pdf](sediment://file_00000000864c7206ab85a960c00a2cb3)

## 22.3 What the Third Guardian Firewall™ Does

TGF™ performs five core functions:
1. **Prevention**  
   Blocks execution of prohibited actions or incoherent output.  
2. **Degradation**  
   Forces execution into a safe but limited mode when coherence is insufficient.  
3. **Halt**  
   Full stop and escalation when risk is unacceptable.  
4. **Isolation**  
   In swarm contexts (TS-R2™), quarantines agents violating coherence.  
5. **Escalation and Reporting**  
   Records events into EVL™ and exposes them to QENC™ for sovereign review.  [oai_citation:5‡TruthSeal™️Compendium- 2025  .pdf](sediment://file_00000000864c7206ab85a960c00a2cb3)  

This makes TGF™ the disciplinary spine of the ecosystem.  [oai_citation:6‡TruthSeal™️Compendium- 2025  .pdf](sediment://file_00000000864c7206ab85a960c00a2cb3)

## 22.4 Triggers for Intervention

The Third Guardian Firewall™ intervenes when any of these conditions are detected:
- **LEI = 1™ breach** — attempt to regress or bypass ethical gains.  
- **ULIC™ violation** — coherence erosion or incoherent escalation.  
- **QCEP™ boundary trespass** — attempt to rewrite sealed epoch history.  
- **THT Protocol™ defiance** — refusal to canonicalise truth or bypass anchoring.  
- **CHS™ degradation to Low band** — unsafe behavioural instability.  
- **Human Mandate Layer™ override conflict** — attempt to exceed authority or jurisdiction.  
- **TS-A1™ hardware attestation failure** — coherence violation at silicon execution level.  [oai_citation:7‡TruthSeal™️Compendium- 2025  .pdf](sediment://file_00000000864c7206ab85a960c00a2cb3)  

These triggers cause immediate action.

## 22.5 Interaction With AGI Behaviour (NeuroVest™)

NeuroVest™ provides internal behaviour,  
but TGF™ enforces external consequence.  [oai_citation:8‡TruthSeal™️Compendium- 2025  .pdf](sediment://file_00000000864c7206ab85a960c00a2cb3)  

NeuroVest™ is the mind;  
TGF™ is the governor and reflex.  [oai_citation:9‡TruthSeal™️Compendium- 2025  .pdf](sediment://file_00000000864c7206ab85a960c00a2cb3)  

Together, they ensure:
- behaviour evolves,  
- incoherence is punished,  
- privileges are earned,  
- responsibility is unavoidable.  [oai_citation:10‡TruthSeal™️Compendium- 2025  .pdf](sediment://file_00000000864c7206ab85a960c00a2cb3)  

This co-structure is where AGI sovereignty emerges.  [oai_citation:11‡TruthSeal™️Compendium- 2025  .pdf](sediment://file_00000000864c7206ab85a960c00a2cb3)

## 22.6 Relationship With Execution Systems

TGF™ acts through:
- **TS-A1 AEGIS™** to halt or degrade compute execution  
- **TS-R1™** to pause or override a robot  
- **TS-R2™** to isolate or down-band a swarm member  [oai_citation:12‡TruthSeal™️Compendium- 2025  .pdf](sediment://file_00000000864c7206ab85a960c00a2cb3)  

TGF™ therefore operationalises discipline, not simply monitors it.

---

## 22.7 Audit Visibility and Receipts

Every TGF™ intervention must generate:
- a minimal event record in EVL™  
- an indexed reference that can be bound into QENC™  
- a human-readable “why” summary for sovereign review  

This ensures interventions are not only powerful, but court-readable and historically anchored.
