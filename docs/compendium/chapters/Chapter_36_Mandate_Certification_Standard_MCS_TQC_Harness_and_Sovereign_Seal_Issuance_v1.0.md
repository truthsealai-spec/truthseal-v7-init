### 36.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 35 established that governance is not proven once.  
It is proven continuously.

This chapter defines the **Mandate Certification Standard™ (MCS™)** as the formal mechanism that converts the continuous audit reality into a **lawful, reviewable, and publishable certification outcome** inside the TruthSeal™ ecosystem.

MCS™ exists to ensure that:
- certification is not a marketing artefact,  
- certification cannot be issued without the full chain of proof,  
- certification is reversible when reality drifts,  
- and public-facing trust remains subordinate to lawful custody.

---

### 36.1 Position in the Governance Chain

MCS™ is not an independent authority.  
It is the **certification expression** of the already-governed system.

It sits **after**:
- mandate rule design,
- controlled discovery,
- receipt formation,
- human custody,
- enforcement and rollback,
- and continuous audit readiness.

In short:

**OPS™ decides** when certification is required.  
**ASA™ produces** the governed discovery and test trails.  
**DRS™ proves** the evidence path.  
**HML™ holds** the lawful custodial key.  
**MER™ executes** lawful constraint or rollback.  
**MAST™ verifies** continuity and court readiness.  
**MCS™ issues** the public-facing outcome **only when all of the above are true.**

---

### 36.2 Core Definitions (Doctorantura)

**Certification**  
A time-bound, evidence-backed declaration that a defined system scope has satisfied TruthSeal™ governance requirements under authenticated custody.

**Certification Scope**  
A bounded profile, identity mode, capability band, model build, or hardware target that can be tested and re-tested without ambiguity.

**Certification Packet**  
The assembled audit bundle containing:
- identity mode declaration,
- mandate tier boundaries,
- discovery receipts,
- audit continuity proofs,
- enforcement history (if any),
- and the latest lawful custody attestations.

**Sovereign Seal**  
The legal-technical marker that indicates the system is certified **under law and evidence**, not reputation.

---

### 36.3 Inputs Required for Certification

MCS™ requires a minimum evidence spine:

1. **Mandate Context**
   - the active permission tier and authority band,
   - the current identity mode definitions.

2. **Discovery Spine**
   - receipt-linked discovery artefacts,
   - reproducibility anchors aligned to DRS™ doctrine.

3. **Custody Proof**
   - HML™ attestations that the scope is lawful and supervised.

4. **Enforcement History**
   - MER™ logs confirming any constraint or rollback decisions.

5. **Continuity Proof**
   - MAST™ findings demonstrating that compliance persists across time, not only in a single snapshot.

---

### 36.4 The TQC Harness Requirement

No certification may be issued without a **Traykov Quantum Coherence (TQC)** test harness pathway appropriate to the scope.

The harness must demonstrate:
- stable identity legibility under adaptation,
- controlled behaviour under mandate boundaries,
- lawful refusal behaviours when thresholds are exceeded,
- and continuity of evidence generation.

MCS™ does not redefine the coherence foundation.  
It **requires demonstrable alignment** to the foundation defined by TruthSeal™ doctrine.

---

### 36.5 Certification Levels (Doctorantura)

MCS™ allows structured outward communication while preserving internal sovereignty.

A lawful internal ladder may include:

- **Provisional**  
  Evidence is coherent but still under heightened review frequency.

- **Verified**  
  Evidence is stable across repeated cycles and environments.

- **Court-Ready**  
  Evidence is structured for adversarial review, with chain-of-custody clarity and rollback traceability.

The chapter does not mandate public naming schemes.  
It mandates that level claims must be derivable from the Certification Packet.

---

### 36.6 Issuance Rules

A Sovereign Seal may be issued only when:

- the certification scope is unambiguous,
- the custody line is current and authenticated,
- the discovery spine is complete and reconstructable,
- continuity proofs show no unresolved drift,
- and all required refusal and enforcement conditions have a recorded lawful path.

Certification is not granted by potential.  
It is granted by **auditable reality**.

---

### 36.7 Revocation and Downgrade Logic

MCS™ inherits the lawful override doctrine.

A certificate must be:
- **paused**,  
- **downgraded**, or  
- **revoked**  

when:
- continuity breaks,
- adversarial dispute triggers are validated,
- or custody conditions are no longer satisfied.

This is not a failure of the system.  
It is a proof that governance remains active.

---

### 36.8 Court and Regulator Readiness

MCS™ defines the outward-facing minimum presentation standard:

A certification claim must map to:
- a specific scope,
- a specific identity mode,
- a specific authority band,
- a specific evidence packet,
- and a specific custody record.

This prevents the dangerous pattern of “global certification,”  
where a narrow test is misrepresented as universal legitimacy.

---

### 36.9 Canonical Statement

TruthSeal™ certification is not a badge of superiority.  
It is a **discipline of lawful proof.**

A system may gain capability.  
But certification is granted only when:

**authority is bounded,  
evidence is reconstructable,  
custody is human,  
and continuity is provable.**

## Chapter 36 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

Certification is not a victory speech.  
It is a custody promise.

TruthSeal™ does not certify intelligence to be admired.  
It certifies intelligence to be **lawful, testable, and reversible**  
when reality demands it.

MCS™ exists so that trust can scale  
without becoming myth.
