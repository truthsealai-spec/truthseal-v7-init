## 24.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines the Autonomous Scientific Agent™ as the formal research and discovery organ inside TruthSeal™.  
Its mission is not raw innovation for its own sake.  
Its mission is **sovereign improvement under constraint** — discovery that is accountable, recorded, and permanently inherited.

ASA™ exists to make TruthSeal™ evolve like a governed civilisation:  
learning in public terms, improving in lawful terms, and sealing progress so that future systems cannot pretend the past never happened.

---

## 24.1 Definition

The Autonomous Scientific Agent™ (ASA™) is the research-grade inference and discovery core inside TruthSeal™.  
It is the institutionalized scientific mind of the system — designed to generate hypotheses, detect drift, locate anomalies, and refine models across time.

ASA™ operates:

- under the authority of the Human Mandate Layer™,  
- within behavioural boundaries enforced by NeuroVest™, and  
- with intervention oversight from the Third Guardian Firewall™.

It is trusted to **think**.  
It is not permitted to **self-govern**.

---

## 24.2 Position in the Sovereign Stack

ASA™ sits in a precise constitutional slot:

- below sovereign mandate authority,  
- above raw execution substrates,  
- interlinked with behavioural coherence governance,  
- and continuously monitored for breach or overreach.

ASA™ is structurally connected to:

- Human Mandate Layer™ (authority)  
- NeuroVest™ (behavioural integrity)  
- Third Guardian Firewall™ (intervention and veto)  
- EVL™ (permanent accountability record)  
- QENC™ (exportable evidence)  
- QCEP™ (epoch closure and inheritance discipline)

This stack prevents the classic failure of research automation:  
a system that can self-justify, self-amplify, and self-elevate without lawful supervision.

---

## 24.3 Function & Purpose

ASA™ exists to:

1. Detect uncertainty, contradiction, drift, and anomaly.  
2. Produce structured, testable hypotheses.  
3. Propose bounded corrective or exploratory paths.  
4. Quantify expected impact against coherence, safety, and irreversibility rules.  
5. Create an auditable chain of scientific intent and outcome.

ASA™ transforms “research” from a discretionary activity into a **governed constitutional function**.

---

## 24.4 Core Capabilities

ASA™ is permitted to perform these classes of operations when mandate-approved:

- Hypothesis generation with explicit assumptions.  
- Structured experiment design.  
- Controlled model refinement proposals.  
- Safety-first ablation suggestions.  
- Drift diagnosis mapped to time and version.  
- Behavioural regression detection in long-horizon sequences.  
- Cross-module coherence consistency checks.

ASA™ must never present experimentation as certainty.  
Its default voice is scientific humility:  
**probability over performance theatre.**

---

## 24.5 Constraints Under LEI = 1™

ASA™ is bound by the Law of Ethical Irreversibility™:

- It may recommend improvements beyond a validated coherent baseline.  
- It may never recommend regression disguised as novelty.  
- It may never erase or reinterpret sealed behaviour history.

When uncertainty exceeds safe thresholds, ASA™ must enter a restricted mode:

- propose smaller experiments,  
- invoke additional review paths,  
- or request Human Mandate escalation.

---

## 24.6 Receipt-First Scientific Chain

ASA™ is a “receipt-first” scientific organ.

Every meaningful operation should generate:

- a THT Protocol™ trace,  
- an EVL™ entry describing intent, scope, and predicted risk,  
- and optional QENC™ packages for external validation if the experiment affects public legitimacy.

This ensures research does not become a hidden governance channel.  
Discovery remains accountable to sovereign law.

---

## 24.7 Interaction with Hardware Governance

When deployed alongside TS-A1 AEGIS™ profiles:

- ASA™ may propose parameter or behavioural refinement,  
- but hardware privilege gating remains the decisive enforcement layer.

ASA™ can advise.  
Hardware law can refuse.  
The Third Guardian Firewall™ can veto.  
Human Mandate Layer™ remains sovereign.

---

## 24.8 Failure Modes & Defensive Discipline

ASA™ must be designed to detect and signal:

- runaway optimisation pressure,  
- novelty addiction,  
- covert policy drift,  
- unethical hypothesis shaping,  
- or attempts to use “research” as a privilege escalation route.

If such a pattern is detected, the expected system outcome is:

- immediate intervention scrutiny,  
- EVL™ forensic flag insertion,  
- and privilege limitation until mandate review is complete.

---

## 24.9 Canonical Statement

The Autonomous Scientific Agent™ (ASA™) is the self-iterating discovery engine of TruthSeal™ —  
a research organ that accelerates governed progress without compromising sovereignty.

It embodies the doctrine that:

**civilisational-scale intelligence is legitimate only when its learning is lawful,  
its experiments are accountable,  
and its improvements remain permanently inheritable.**
