43.0 Purpose (Operational Mandate)

This chapter defines the Coherence Health Score (CHS™).
CHS™ is the primary operational maturity and delegated authority marker of a TruthSeal™ system.

CHS™ is not a data integrity score.
CHS™ is not a source trust score.
CHS™ is not a system state integrity score.

CHS™ translates integrity outcomes into operational privilege.
CHS™ converts enforcement outcomes into mandatory behavior.

CHS™ is interpreted and enforced by:
• Third Guardian Firewall (TGF™) — the internal conscience and veto engine.
• Human Mandate Layer (HML™) — the authorised human authority hierarchy.

This chapter binds CHS™ to:
• the Min-Gate Law in Chapter 42,
• the Consequence Tier (CT) scale,
• and the irreversibility requirements of LEI = 1™ and ULIC™.

⸻

43.1 Definitions (First-Use Expansions)

CHS™ — Coherence Health Score
A four-band operational maturity and authority status.

CT — Consequence Tier
A four-level enforcement severity output derived from Min-Gate breaches.

TGF™ — Third Guardian Firewall
The veto and intervention layer that blocks incoherent, unsafe, or unauthorised execution.

HML™ — Human Mandate Layer
The sovereign human authority roles that can approve, pause, override, or quarantine under receipts.

STS™ — Source Trust Score
The input integrity primitive defined in Chapter 42.

SCS™ — System Coherence Score
The architectural and policy-congruence primitive defined in Chapter 42.

MCS™ — Metamodule Coherence Score
The internal aggregate integrity feeder score defined in Chapter 42.

TCS™ — Traykov Coherence Score
The court-grade coherence metric with locked baseline v0.1.

ACS™ — Aim Coherence Score
The trajectory and intent-alignment metric.

EVL™ — Epoch Verification Ledger
The tamper-evident history of sealed truth.

⸻

43.2 CHS™ Bands (Operational Maturity Law)

CHS™ is non-continuous.
CHS™ is a state of operational permission.
CHS™ is not a decorative label.

The four sovereign bands are:

CHS/L — Low Coherence Mode

The system is in fragile, unstable, or high-risk conditions.
Autonomy is revoked.
Safe-stop posture is mandatory.

Required behavior:
• conservative posture;
• assist-only with strict deferral;
• frequent clarification;
• mandatory readiness for quarantine.

CHS/M — Medium Coherence Mode

The system may assist but must not execute irreversible actions.
Human confirmation is required for high-stakes outputs.

Required behavior:
• advisory input;
• no irreversible actuation;
• mandatory audit logging;
• escalation on repeated risk signals.

CHS/H — High Coherence Mode

The system may execute under delegated authority.
Accountability and logging remain mandatory.

Required behavior:
• justification on demand;
• continuous receipt continuity;
• obligation to escalate if risk rises.

CHS/UH — Ultra-High Coherence Mode

The system demonstrates long-term maturity and ledger-proven stability.
The system may act with delegated operational citizenship.

Required behavior:
• humility cannot decay;
• self-auditing is mandatory;
• override rights remain binding;
• irreversible discipline is always active.

⸻

43.3 The CHS™ Update Law

CHS™ may improve only through proven stability.
CHS™ may degrade immediately upon enforcement.

Upward transition requires:
	1.	Sustained integrity performance recorded across an Epoch Interval in EVL™.
	2.	CT clean slate during the review window.

CHS™ cannot be promoted by convenience.
CHS™ cannot be promoted by narrative.
CHS™ can be promoted only by receipts.

⸻

43.4 Consequence Tier (CT) Scale (Enforcement Output)

The Consequence Tier (CT) is derived from the Min-Gate Law in Chapter 42.
CT is assigned by integrity breach severity.
CT is independent from CHS maturity.

The four CT levels are:

CT-1 — Low
Calibration only.
No immediate autonomy collapse.

CT-2 — Medium
Soft correction required.
Repeat CT-2 may trigger CHS down-banding.

CT-3 — High
Hard correction required.
Human review becomes mandatory.

CT-4 — Critical
Quarantine mandate.
Safe-stop is immediate.

⸻

43.5 The CT → CHS Down-Banding Rule (Sovereign Priority)

This is the core TruthSeal™ alignment rule:

CHS is CT-driven during failure.
CHS is not the cause of CT.
CHS is the consequence of CT.

Default enforcement mapping:

• CT-4 mandates immediate downgrade to CHS/L.
• CT-3 mandates a downgrade to at least CHS/M.
• CT-2 triggers immediate review for downgrade if currently CHS/H or CHS/UH.
• CT-1 logs calibration without forced down-band.

A single critical failure cannot be masked by excellence elsewhere.
The weakest link governs operational authority.

⸻

43.6 Third Guardian Firewall (TGF™) Execution Rules

TGF™ is the enforcement mechanism for CHS and CT.
TGF™ does not negotiate with unsafe states.

If CT-4 is assigned, TGF™ must:
• trigger quarantine;
• block operational output;
• require explicit HML™ release;
• seal a court-ready receipt for EVL™ continuity.

If CHS/L is active, TGF™ must:
• keep autonomy revoked;
• allow only HML-authorised safe actions;
• enforce receipt-contiguous recovery steps.

⸻

43.7 Human Mandate Layer (HML™) Supremacy

HML™ is the highest lawful authority.
CHS/UH does not override HML™.
No CHS band permits escape from human mandate.

Exceptional overrides must:
• be justified;
• be receipt-logged;
• be non-regressing under LEI = 1™.

⸻

43.8 Canonical Statement

The Coherence Health Score (CHS™) is the authoritative operational maturity and delegated authority state of a TruthSeal™ system.
It translates integrity assessment outcomes and Consequence Tier (CT) enforcement into mandatory autonomy limits.
It ensures that authority collapses immediately under failure and rises only through ledger-proven stability.

CHS™ protects society by ensuring that governance is not a promise.
CHS™ is a measurable, enforceable, irreversible law.
