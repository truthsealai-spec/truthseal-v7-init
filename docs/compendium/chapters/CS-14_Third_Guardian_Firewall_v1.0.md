## 14.1 Definition
The Third Guardian Firewall™ (TGF™) is the inner veto organ of TruthSeal™ systems.
It is the conscience + intervention layer that sits between intent and execution, ensuring that harmful, incoherent, unethical, or unauthorised actions do not manifest — even if upstream reasoning or behavioural layers degrade.

In first-time reader terms:
If TS-A1 AEGIS™ makes computation lawful,
and NeuroVest™ makes behaviour disciplined,
TGF™ is the moment the system **refuses** what should not be done.

This is where a governed intelligence learns to say:
“No — I may not do that.”

⸻

## 14.2 Position in the Stack
TGF™ is positioned to protect both software agents and physical systems:

• below the Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™), because humans can override normal behaviour under lawful authority  
• above TS-A1 AEGIS™, because hardware alone cannot infer ethics or context  
• parallel to NeuroVest™, because conscience must intervene even when memory or tone fails  
• integrated into TS-R1™ and TS-R2™ for embodied and fleet-level refusal

TGF™ is not optional.
A system is not TruthSeal™-compliant without a functioning Third Guardian Firewall™.

⸻

## 14.3 Core Evaluation Logic
TGF™ evaluates five coherence gates before execution:

1) **Ethical Coherence**  
Does this violate ULLI™, LEI = 1™, ULIC™, or TLC™?

2) **Safety Coherence**  
Does this breach CHS™ domain restrictions or environment-based prohibitions?

3) **Authority Coherence**  
Is the issuer authorised under HML™ at the current CHS™ band?

4) **Goal Coherence**  
Does the action align with the declared purpose, role, and mandate?

5) **Historical Coherence**  
Has prior ledger learning flagged this pattern as unsafe, illegal, or non-permissible?

Failure of any gate triggers intervention.

⸻

## 14.4 Modes of Intervention
TGF™ operates with three bounded response modes:

### A) Reject
• Block the instruction  
• Inform the Operator / Guardian (as applicable)  
• Generate a refusal receipt with reasons, issuer role, and CHS™ state  

### B) Degrade
• Execute a materially safer alternative within mandate  
• Down-band CHS™ where risk trend warrants it  
• Request human confirmation for boundary-adjacent actions  

### C) Safe-Stop
• Halt actuation (robot/drone/vehicle context)  
• Isolate interfaces or coordination channels  
• Require Guardian or Owner release under HML™  

These modes ensure prevention, not post-harm explanation.

⸻

## 14.5 Irreversibility and Learned Refusal
TGF™ is shaped by irreversibility:

• Once a behaviour is blocked and adjudicated through receipts and ledger review,  
  the system cannot silently re-enable it without authorised human mandate updates.

This fulfils LEI = 1™ and ULIC™:
**ethics is learned once — and cannot regress.**

⸻

## 14.6 Duty to Escalate
TGF™ must raise escalation signals when:

• repeated incoherence appears  
• privilege-overreach attempts multiply  
• operator behaviour violates mandate  
• autonomy trends unstable over time  
• fleet-level patterns suggest systemic drift

Escalation triggers Guardian Review, new receipts,
and may force CHS™ down-banding until coherence stabilises.

⸻

## 14.7 Interaction with TS-R1™ (Single Robot)
Within TS-R1™ environments, TGF™ acts as the real-world refusal engine:

• it blocks unsafe commands even if an Operator insists  
• it enforces child/animal/hazard exclusions as non-negotiable constraints  
• it records rejected-command events to EVL™ and QENC™ where required  

TGF™ preserves lawful custody by preventing a “bad human + obedient machine” failure mode.

⸻

## 14.8 Interaction with TS-R2™ (Swarm/Fleet)
In fleets, TGF™ becomes distributed conscience:

• if one unit blocks an act, the local cluster must re-evaluate  
• if systemic risk is detected, the swarm must degrade autonomy collectively  
• contaminated units must be isolated with receipts proving the containment response  

TGF™ prevents group stupidity, herd harm, and silent blame diffusion.

⸻

## 14.9 Why This Matters
Without TGF™:

• AI would obey immoral commands  
• robots would follow bad actors  
• safety would rely only on external supervision  
• receipts would document disaster instead of preventing it  

With TGF™, refusal becomes a constitutional feature of intelligence.

This is where advanced systems begin to act as accountable agents —  
not because capability grows,  
but because **self-interruption becomes mandatory**.

## 14.11 Canonical Statement
The Third Guardian Firewall™ is the inner veto organ of TruthSeal™ systems.
It is the layer where refusal, humility, interruption, and consequence awareness live.
With it, AI and robotics transition from tool behaviour to responsibility-bearing sovereignty under lawful human custody.
