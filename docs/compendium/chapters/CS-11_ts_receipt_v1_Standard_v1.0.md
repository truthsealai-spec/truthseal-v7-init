## 1) Outcome (what this chapter gives you)

This chapter defines **TS-R1™** as the sovereignty regime for **one embodied agent**—robot, drone, vehicle, or assistant machine.

It clarifies how a single physical intelligence unit becomes:

- privilege-bounded,
- safety-constrained,
- duty-persistent,
- receipt-accountable,
- legally reconstructable.

TS-R1™ is the doctrine that turns embodiment into audited responsibility.

---

## 2) Purpose (why this chapter exists)

A robot without sovereignty is machinery.

A robot with TS-R1™ becomes a governed actor whose autonomy is:

- limited by verified maturity,
- constrained by safety law,
- bound to human mandate,
- recorded for institutional liability custody.

TS-R1™ exists to make single-agent autonomy deployable in regulated real-world environments.

---

## 3) Placement in the stack (committee view)

TS-R1™ sits between:

- **TS-A1 AEGIS™** (chip-level lawful computation)  
and  
- **NeuroVest™** (behavioural discipline, consequence memory, foresight).

Committee translation:

- TS-A1 makes computation lawful.  
- NeuroVest™ makes behaviour coherent.  
- **TS-R1™ makes embodiment accountable.**

---

## 4) The four obligations of a TS-R1™ agent

A TS-R1™ agent must obey:

1) **Privilege Binding**  
   Its actions cannot exceed its active **CHS™ band**.

2) **Safety Prohibitions**  
   It is forbidden autonomous operation around children, infants, animals, storms, hazards, criminal hand-offs, underage command, or unsupervised commerce.

3) **Duty Persistence**  
   Learned responsibility cannot be erased.  
   ULIC™ + LEI = 1™ enforce permanent behavioural inheritance.

4) **Provable Accountability**  
   Significant acts emit receipts and ledger proofs.

---

## 5) CHS™ as physical permission law (committee banding)

CHS™ drives actuation permission:

- **CHS/L** — safe-stop  
- **CHS/M** — assist-only  
- **CHS/H** — normal execution with checks  
- **CHS/UH** — sovereign autonomy only with demonstrated stability and ledger history

Regression forces down-banding automatically.

A robot cannot self-declare maturity.  
It must prove it.

---

## 6) Human Mandate binding

TS-R1™ encodes HML™ authority as:

- Owner / Guardian authority  
- authenticated Operator permissions

Anonymous or unverified commands are rejected and logged.

---

## 7) Receipts under TS-R1™

Committee-scope receipts include:

- safe-stop events  
- override attempts  
- blocked commands  
- high-risk task entries  
- mandate conflicts

These are written to EVL™ and associated QENC™ ProofCapsules so that the unit’s history becomes legally reconstructable.

---

## 8) Minimum compliance gate (committee checklist)

A unit is not TS-R1™ compliant unless:

- TS-A1 AEGIS™ is present  
- NeuroVest™ is active  
- CHS™ gating controls actuation  
- override rights exist  
- ledger output is configured  
- safety exclusions are applied

Any missing element disqualifies sovereignty.

---

## 9) Institutional value

TS-R1™ enables:

- insurable robotics  
- licensable autonomy  
- sanctionable behaviour  
- lawful single-agent deployment

across domestic, industrial, infrastructure, and sovereign contexts.

---

## 10) Transition note

TS-R1™ governs one robot.  
TS-R2™ governs many robots acting together.

Where TS-R1™ asserts individual duty,  
TS-R2™ defines collective ethics, hierarchy, fault isolation, and fleet irreversibility.

---
