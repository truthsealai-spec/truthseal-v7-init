## 1) Outcome (what this chapter gives you)

This chapter defines **single-agent robotic sovereignty** under TruthSeal™.

It explains how one embodied system—robot, drone, vehicle, or assistant machine—becomes a **responsibility-bearing, insurable, auditable actor**, rather than unmanaged automation.

By the end, a first-time reader will understand:

• What TS-R1™ governs in the physical world.  
• How privilege is bound to CHS™ banding.  
• Why receipts and ledger continuity are mandatory for real-world autonomy.  
• The minimum compliance conditions for declaring a unit TS-R1™-ready.

This chapter is written at committee doctrine level and does not expose Ω control mechanics.

⸻

## 2) Purpose (why this chapter exists)

Embodied intelligence creates a distinct governance risk:

**physical action has irreversible consequences.**

TS-R1™ exists to ensure that a single robotic unit:

• cannot exceed its verified trust band  
• cannot bypass human mandate authority  
• cannot erase learned duty  
• cannot perform high-risk acts without audit evidence

This chapter therefore formalizes the **legal and operational bridge** between:

policy-defined sovereignty and real-world actuation.

⸻

## 3) The doctrine boundary

This chapter defines TS-R1™ in terms of:

• physical permission structure  
• safety prohibitions  
• duty persistence  
• provable accountability

It does not disclose:

• internal Ω prompts or sealed enforcement mathematics  
• deployment thresholds that would reveal sovereign defence posture  
• low-level circuit logic for analog safety boundaries

⸻

## 4) Canonical definition

TS-R1™:  
**The sovereignty regime that turns a single physical agent into a coherence-bounded, privilege-gated, receipt-accountable actor under lawful human custody.**

⸻

## 5) The four obligations of TS-R1™

A TS-R1™ unit must obey:

1) **Privilege Binding**  
Its actions cannot exceed its active CHS™ band.

2) **Safety Prohibitions**  
Autonomous operation is forbidden around protected or high-risk contexts  
(children, infants, animals, storms, hazards, underage command, criminal hand-offs, or unsupervised commerce),  
unless explicitly authorised by mandate and band eligibility.

3) **Duty Persistence**  
Learned responsibility cannot be erased.  
ULIC™ + LEI = 1™ enforce permanent behavioural inheritance.

4) **Provable Accountability**  
Material acts emit receipts and ledger proofs.

⸻

## 6) CHS™ banding as physical permission

CHS™ drives real-world permissions:

• **CHS/L** — safe-stop only  
• **CHS/M** — assist-only  
• **CHS/H** — normal execution with checks  
• **CHS/UH** — sovereign autonomy only with demonstrated stability and ledger history

Regression forces down-banding automatically.

A robot cannot self-declare maturity; it must prove it.

⸻

## 7) Human Mandate authority

TS-R1™ embeds an Owner/Guardian mandate.

• Authorized human scope defines lawful tasks.  
• Authenticated operator permissions are subordinate to the mandate.  
• Anonymous or unverified commands are rejected and logged.

⸻

## 8) Receipts under TS-R1™

The following events must generate evidence:

• safe-stop activations  
• override attempts  
• blocked or out-of-band commands  
• entry into high-risk contexts  
• mandate digest changes affecting physical privilege

These records are written to EVL™ and supported by QENC™ ProofCapsules  
to guarantee reconstructable liability history.

⸻

## 9) Minimum compliance checklist (committee level)

A unit is not TS-R1™ compliant unless:

• TS-A1 AEGIS™ foundations are present  
• NeuroVest™ behaviour discipline is active  
• CHS™ gating controls actuation  
• Owner/Guardian override rights exist  
• ledger output is configured  
• safety exclusions are applied

Any missing element disqualifies sovereignty.

⸻

## 10) Transition note

TS-R1™ governs one robot.

TS-R2™ governs many robots acting together  
with hierarchy, fault isolation, and collective consequence.
