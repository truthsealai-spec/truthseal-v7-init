## 35.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 34 defined how authority is enforced, revoked, and lawfully rolled back.  
This chapter formalises the **Mandate Audit Standard™ (MAS™)** as the continuous proof layer that confirms:

- governance remains active after enforcement,
- policy is executed as-written,
- receipts remain reconstructable,
- and readiness for lawful review is maintained at all times.

MAS™ exists because **power without ongoing audit becomes narrative again.**

---

## 35.1 Definition of Mandate Audit

A Mandate Audit is a structured, repeatable evaluation of whether a TruthSeal™ governed system:

1. is operating inside its authorised mandate tier,  
2. is obeying escalation and refusal rules,  
3. is producing valid receipts when required, and  
4. remains legally reconstructable under dispute.

This audit is not a marketing ceremony.  
It is **the living proof that the mandate is still real.**

---

## 35.2 Audit Domains

MAS™ evaluates the full governance surface, including:

- **Operational prompts and control rules** that determine when action is lawful.  
- **Discovery workflows** that generate governed scientific or technical claims.  
- **Receipt integrity** across lifecycle, dispute, and enforcement moments.  
- **Human custody decisions** and emergency override records.  
- **Rollback and revocation traceability** from the enforcement layer.

MAS™ treats these as one chain.  
A break anywhere weakens admissibility everywhere.

---

## 35.3 Audit Triggers

MAS™ may be activated by:

- **Scheduled cadence** (institutional or sovereign policy).  
- **Authority change** (promotion, demotion, or band reclassification).  
- **Incident or anomaly** (unexpected behaviour, safety flags, drift signals).  
- **Dispute initiation** (formal challenge to a claim or decision).  
- **Regulatory or partner request** (court, agency, or procurement audit).

In TruthSeal™, *audit is not a reaction to suspicion.*  
It is a permanent expectation of lawful intelligence.

---

## 35.4 Required Evidence Package

A complete MAS™ evidence bundle should include:

- the current **authority tier and band declaration**,  
- the governing **control rule set** for that band,  
- a sample of **executed decisions** under that band,  
- **Receipt sets** covering discovery, refusal, escalation, and enforcement,  
- the **Human Mandate Layer™** custody trail,  
- and **Mandate Enforcement & Revocation™** intervention proofs where applicable.

The guiding principle is simple:

**If a decision cannot be reconstructed, it cannot be treated as sovereign truth.**

---

## 35.5 Audit Outcomes

MAS™ supports three primary outcomes:

1. **Pass**  
   The system is operating within mandate boundaries with complete, coherent receipts.

2. **Conditional Pass**  
   The system is compliant, but documentation or receipt coverage requires tightening within a defined window.

3. **Fail**  
   The mandate cannot be proven as executed.  
   Authority must be constrained, paused, or rolled back until audit integrity is restored.

MAS™ is the quiet discipline that prevents *permission creep* from becoming *civilisational risk.*

---

## 35.6 Court Readiness Checklist (Doctorantura)

A MAS™ record is considered court-ready when it shows:

- stable identity and custody attribution,  
- explicit authority scope at the time of action,  
- cryptographic continuity of receipt chains,  
- clear linkage to governing rules,  
- and repeatable reconstruction by a third party.

Court readiness is not achieved by confidence.  
It is achieved by **structure.**

---

## 35.7 Relationship to OPS™, ASA™, DRS™, HML™, and MER™

This chapter confirms a doctrine of permanent alignment:

- **Operational Prompts Standard™ (OPS™)** determines when audit and receipt discipline must apply.  
- **Autonomous Scientific Agent™ (ASA™)** executes governed discovery under allowed authority bands.  
- **Discovery Receipt Standard™ (DRS™)** proves the discovery path and preserves admissibility.  
- **Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™)** remains the lawful custody line for escalation, pause, and override.  
- **Mandate Enforcement & Revocation™ (MER™)** is the immediate execution bridge when authority must be constrained or reversed.  
- **Mandate Audit Standard™ (MAS™)** verifies that this entire chain remains real in practice.

MAS™ is the continuity law that prevents governance from becoming symbolic.

## Chapter 35 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

Governance is not proven once.  
It is proven continuously.

TruthSeal™ does not trust intelligence to remain lawful by intention.  
It requires **auditable continuity**.

MAS™ exists so that  
authority can scale without becoming invisible,  
and power can grow without escaping custody.
