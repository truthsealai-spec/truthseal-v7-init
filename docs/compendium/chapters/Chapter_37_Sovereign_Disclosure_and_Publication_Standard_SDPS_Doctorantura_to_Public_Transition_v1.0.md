## 37.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 36 established the Mandate Certification Standard™ (MCS™): how TruthSeal™ certifies a system under lawful harness, issues a sovereign seal, and makes a court-ready release possible.

This chapter defines the next boundary:

**certified intelligence is not automatically publishable intelligence.**

The Sovereign Disclosure and Publication Standard™ (SDPS™) is the doctrine that controls how TruthSeal™ moves a capability, a method, or a doctrine from internal custody into lawful public reality.

SDPS™ prevents the most dangerous governance failure of all:

**a system that is technically compliant but socially unleashed.**

---

## 37.1 Core Definitions

**Doctorantura Edition**  
The internal, sovereign doctrine layer used to establish rigorous claims, design law, and custody structures before public exposure.

**Public Edition**  
The externally shareable layer that preserves TruthSeal™’s legal and technical integrity while removing internal-only information, sensitive operational details, and classified or premature mechanisms.

**Disclosure Boundary**  
A formal policy line that separates what may be proven internally from what may be shared publicly without increasing risk, confusion, or misuse.

**Publication Event**  
The governed act of releasing an artifact, doctrine, profile, or capability into the Public Edition—paired with receipts and custody metadata.

---

## 37.2 Why SDPS™ Must Exist

TruthSeal™ cannot allow a world where:

- internal validation is mistaken for universal permission,
- a narrow certification is marketed as unlimited safety,
- sensitive mechanisms are exposed before enforcement infrastructure is stable,
- philosophical identity doctrines are diluted into brand slogans,
- or adversaries can reconstruct protected design constraints from public text.

SDPS™ exists to ensure that TruthSeal™ remains:

**powerful without becoming reckless,  
transparent without becoming exploitable,  
and publishable without becoming myth-making.**

---

## 37.3 The Disclosure Ladder

SDPS™ defines four lawful publication bands:

1. **Internal Only (Doctorantura Core)**  
   - For foundational laws, enforcement mechanics, early proofs, and sensitive operational pathways.

2. **Restricted Partner (Controlled Audience)**  
   - For vetted institutions, regulators, or strategic hardware and infrastructure partners under explicit custody terms.

3. **Public Operational (General Release)**  
   - For stable doctrines, safe summaries, and clearly bounded methods that cannot be misused to bypass enforcement.

4. **Public Educational (Broad Literacy)**  
   - For simplified explanations, analogies, and narrative framing that expand understanding without revealing operational attack surfaces.

---

## 37.4 The Redaction Law

TruthSeal™ does not publish by deletion alone.  
It publishes by **coherence-preserving translation**.

SDPS™ redaction must:

- preserve the logical spine of the claim,
- maintain authorship and provenance clarity,
- avoid overclaiming,
- remove sensitive enforcement bypass information,
- and explicitly state any remaining uncertainties.

If a public text would require a hidden mechanism to remain safe, it is not yet eligible for public release.

---

## 37.5 The Publication Package

Every lawful Publication Event must include:

- **the public artifact**,  
- **a disclosure band declaration**,  
- **a provenance header**,  
- **a custody reference**,  
- **a receipt binding statement**,  
- and **a clear boundary of claims**.

This ensures that TruthSeal™’s public truth is:

**verifiable, reconstructable, and legally defensible  
without exposing internal-only governance layers.**

---

## 37.6 Relationship to MCS™, MAST™, and HML™

SDPS™ does not replace certification or audit.

It binds them to social reality.

- **MCS™** confirms a system is certifiable under lawful tests.  
- **MAST™** confirms that compliance remains continuous over time.  
- **HML™** governs the sovereign right to pause, restrict, or reverse disclosure.  
- **SDPS™** governs when any of that may be safely presented to the world.

---

## 37.7 Relationship to DRS™, OPS™, and ASA™

SDPS™ is aligned with discovery governance:

- **OPS™** decides when discovery and receipts are required.  
- **ASA™** executes governed discovery.  
- **DRS™** proves the discovery path and preserves admissibility.  
- **SDPS™** decides which parts of that proof may be safely published  
  and how that publication must remain custody-aligned.

---

## 37.8 Failure Modes Prevented

SDPS™ explicitly prevents:

- **Prestige publication** — releasing to impress rather than to govern.  
- **Scope inflation** — marketing a bounded certification as universal safety.  
- **Adversarial reconstruction** — enabling bypass via over-detailed public explanation.  
- **Narrative drift** — turning legal doctrine into ideology.  
- **Premature identity exposure** — allowing unstable identity modes into public integration paths.

---

## 37.9 Canonical Statement

TruthSeal™ does not publish intelligence to celebrate it.

It publishes intelligence to **civilise it**.

A system may gain capability.  
But public legitimacy is granted only when:

**authority is bounded,  
evidence is reconstructable,  
custody is human,  
and disclosure is safe.**

## Chapter 37 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

Truth is not only discovered.  
It is **released under law**.

TruthSeal™ does not fear public scrutiny.  
It fears **unbounded publication without custody**.

SDPS™ exists so that  
progress can become public  
without becoming dangerous,  
and doctrine can become shared  
without becoming exploitable.
