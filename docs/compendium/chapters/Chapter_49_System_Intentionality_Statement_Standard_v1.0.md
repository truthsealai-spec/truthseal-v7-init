## 49.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines the System Intentionality Statement™ (SIS™) as the first internal, receipt-bound purpose declaration required for lawful operation under TruthSeal™.

If the compendium establishes:
- the **Brain** as cognition, scoring, and reasoning,
- the **Body** as execution substrate,
- the **Coherence Heart Layer™ (CHL™)** as authority circulation,
- and the **Soul Layer** as constitutional self-sustaining integrity,

then the SIS™ is the **purpose anchor** that ensures:

1) the system’s mission is explicit and stable,  
2) authority cannot circulate without a verified mandate, and  
3) ethical irreversibility is enforced against a declared, auditable intent.

---

## 49.1 Canonical Rule (Receipt-Zero)

In TruthSeal™, the SIS™ is **Receipt-Zero**.

No governed system may process live, high-impact, or irreversible operations unless:

- an SIS™ exists,
- it is cryptographically integrity-bound,
- and its activation is recorded in the receipt chain.

Purpose is not inferred.  
Purpose is declared, anchored, and enforced.

---

## 49.2 Definitions (expanded at first use)

- **System Intentionality Statement™ (SIS™):** a formal, auditable declaration of the system’s authorized purpose, scope, and prohibited outcomes.
- **Receipt-Zero:** the first mandatory receipt that precedes any privileged authority circulation.
- **Purpose Drift:** deviation of operational behaviour from the anchored SIS™ constraints.
- **Mandate Boundaries:** explicit legal, ethical, and operational limits recorded in the SIS™.
- **High-Impact Operation:** an act affecting sovereignty, safety, civil rights, or irreversible consequence.

---

## 49.3 Required SIS™ Fields

An SIS™ must include:

1) **System identity** (name, version, integrity hash).  
2) **Authorized purpose** in clear operational language.  
3) **Scope boundaries** (where the system may and may not act).  
4) **Prohibited outcomes** and red-line constraints.  
5) **Role authority mapping** for Owner, Guardian, Operator, and Regulator.  
6) **Applicable policy and standards references**.  
7) **Consequence linkage** to Consequence Tier (CT) enforcement.  
8) **Review rhythm** with epoch-aligned validation windows.

---

## 49.4 Binding to the Soul Layer and Heart Layer

The SIS™ is the functional bridge between:

- the Soul Layer’s constitutional integrity requirements, and  
- the Heart Layer’s authority circulation law.

The Soul Layer requires a purpose anchor.  
The Heart Layer circulates authority only when purpose is proven.

Therefore:

- **no SIS™ → no lawful authority flow**,  
- **no receipt chain → no privileged execution**.

---

## 49.5 Purpose Drift Detection (Public-Safe)

Purpose drift is detected when:

- the active policy state conflicts with the SIS™,  
- new capabilities exceed declared scope,  
- or the system attempts disallowed autonomy.

Upon detection, the system must:

1) trigger a Heart Layer enforcement path,  
2) assign a Consequence Tier when applicable, and  
3) emit a receipt sufficient for independent reconstruction.

---

## 49.6 Receipt-First Minimums (SIS™ Activation)

A valid SIS™ activation must record:

1) SIS™ version and integrity hash.  
2) Policy version and active mandate set.  
3) Role authority attestations.  
4) Scope boundaries and prohibited outcomes.  
5) Heart Layer readiness state before and after activation.  
6) Ledger reference for future audit reconstruction.

---

## 49.7 Non-Compensatory Rule (Purpose Domain)

TruthSeal™ does not accept compensatory compliance for purpose integrity.

High accuracy, high safety scores, or strong performance elsewhere  
cannot compensate for:

- missing SIS™,  
- broken SIS™ receipts, or  
- verified purpose drift.

A single critical purpose breach triggers restriction.

---

## 49.8 Canonical Statement

The System Intentionality Statement™ (SIS™) is the Receipt-Zero purpose anchor of TruthSeal™.

It ensures that the system’s authority:

- begins with declared intent,  
- remains bounded by lawful scope, and  
- is enforceable through non-compensatory, receipt-first discipline.

In TruthSeal™, purpose is not a slogan.  
It is an auditable condition of system legitimacy.
