**TRUTHSEAL™ SOVEREIGN COMPENDIUM**  
**DOCTORANTURA EDITION v1.0**  
────────────────────────────  

# **Chapter 44 — Consequence Tier (CT™) Enforcement Standard**
version: 1.0  
status: Draft — Diplomatic Edition  
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.), Founder and Chief Architect of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign AGI Framework

## **44.0 Purpose (Operational Mandate)**
This chapter formalizes the Consequence Tier (CT™) enforcement standard of TruthSeal™.  
It defines how the system translates integrity breaches into mandatory corrective force.  
CT™ is the operational consequence scale.  
CT™ is not a health or maturity band.  
CT™ is derived from Min-Gate failures and contradiction severity.  
CT™ is executed by the Third Guardian Firewall™ (TGF™) under Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™) supremacy.  

CT™ exists to guarantee one rule:  
A single critical failure cannot be diluted by high scores elsewhere.  

────────────────────────────  

## **44.1 Foundational Separation (CT™ vs CHS™)**
TruthSeal™ maintains strict separation between consequence and health.  

CT™ describes **what must happen now** after a breach.  
CHS™ describes **what level of autonomy is presently lawful**.  

CT™ is derived independently.  
CT™ may force CHS™ down-banding.  
CHS™ does not generate CT™.  

This preserves the non-compensatory law across the sovereign stack.  

────────────────────────────  

## **44.2 CT™ Definition**
The Consequence Tier (CT™) is a four-level enforcement scale.  
It is triggered by Min-Gate breaches across Source Trust Score (STS™) and System Coherence Score (SCS™) domains.  
It may also be triggered by forensic anomalies or receipt discontinuity.  

CT™ must be recorded as a court-ready receipt.  
CT™ must be discoverable within epoch history.  

────────────────────────────  

## **44.3 CT™ Tiers (Canonical)**
The four CT™ tiers are:  

### **CT-1 — Low**
CT-1 represents minor, localized degradation.  
It requires calibration only.  
It does not mandate immediate autonomy reduction.  
It must still be receipt-logged.  

### **CT-2 — Medium**
CT-2 represents recoverable integrity failure.  
It mandates soft correction.  
It may require temporary autonomy narrowing when risk context is high.  
It must be recorded with explicit remediation intent.  

### **CT-3 — High**
CT-3 represents serious breach of integrity or control.  
It mandates hard correction with mandatory human review.  
It requires immediate CHS™ down-banding to, at minimum, assist-only posture.  
It triggers elevated operator notification under the HML™ policy pack.  

### **CT-4 — Critical**
CT-4 represents existential integrity failure.  
It mandates safe-stop and quarantine posture.  
It requires immediate CHS™ down-banding to the lowest lawful band.  
It blocks all continuation until explicit HML™ Owner/Guardian mandate is issued with a new receipt.  

────────────────────────────  

## **44.4 CT™ Trigger Rules**
CT™ assignment is Min-Gate native.  

A CT™ event is assigned when:  
• any critical STS™ factor falls below the Minimum Gate Threshold (T_min),  
• any critical SCS™ factor falls below T_min,  
• a receipt gap is detected,  
• a post-quantum signature validation failure is detected,  
• a drift spike exceeds the bounded tolerance of the current epoch policy.  

CT™ is assigned by the Coherence Validator.  
CT™ is executed by the Third Guardian Firewall™.  

────────────────────────────  

## **44.5 CT™ → Action Mandates**
CT™ forces mandatory operational outcomes.  

• CT-1 → Calibration.  
• CT-2 → Soft Correction.  
• CT-3 → Hard Correction + Human Review.  
• CT-4 → Quarantine Mode + Safe-Stop.  

These outcomes are not optional.  
They are constitutional enforcement states.  

────────────────────────────  

## **44.6 CT™ → CHS™ Coupling (Mandatory Impact)**
CT™ may force CHS™ down-banding.  

Canonical default rule:  
• CT-1 → No mandatory CHS™ downgrade.  
• CT-2 → Conditional downgrade if system is operating in high autonomy bands.  
• CT-3 → Mandatory downgrade to assist-only band or lower.  
• CT-4 → Mandatory downgrade to safe-stop band and quarantine posture.  

CHS™ recovery must follow the upward gating rules defined in the CHS™ chapter.  

────────────────────────────  

## **44.7 Receipts (CT™ Evidence Standard)**
Every CT™ event emits a receipt.  
The receipt must record:  
• the triggering factor identification,  
• the breached threshold reference,  
• the assigned CT™ tier,  
• the mandated action outcome,  
• the resulting CHS™ state change (if any),  
• the operator/guardian notification rail invoked.  

CT™ receipts must link to EVL™ continuity for epoch traceability.  

If external anchoring networks are unavailable,  
anchoring fields must be recorded as UNKNOWN placeholders  
and back-filled immediately upon service recovery.  

────────────────────────────  

## **44.8 Human Mandate Supremacy**
Only the Human Mandate Layer™  
can authorize:  
• policy changes that alter T_min,  
• overrides of CT-4 quarantine states,  
• exceptional regression paths under LEI = 1™ constraints.  

No automated subsystem  
may self-release from CT-4  
without HML™ authority.  

────────────────────────────  

## **44.9 Auditor Checklist (CT™ Integrity)**
A compliant CT™ implementation must show:  
• strict CT™ vs CHS™ separation,  
• Min-Gate triggers explicitly enumerated,  
• CT-1 to CT-4 tiers defined and stable,  
• mandatory action mapping present,  
• receipt fields complete and court-ready,  
• EVL™ references included,  
• HML™ override conditions explicit,  
• no compensatory loopholes.  

────────────────────────────  

## **44.10 Canonical Statement**
The Consequence Tier (CT™) is the enforcement scale  
that transforms integrity breaches into mandatory operational law.  
It ensures that TruthSeal™ systems  
cannot mask critical failure with high performance elsewhere.  
CT™ is the constitutional consequence engine  
executed by the Third Guardian Firewall™  
under the supremacy of the Human Mandate Layer™.
