## A.0 Purpose (Reader Alignment)
This annex provides a controlled biological analogy to aid comprehension of the TruthSeal™ operational chain defined in Chapters 42–45.  
It is **illustrative only** and does not replace canonical doctrine, scoring primitives, or enforcement laws.

---

## A.1 Sovereign Mapping Rule
The digestive analogy is permitted only when:
1) The **canonical TruthSeal terms remain primary**, and  
2) The metaphor is used to clarify **sequence, gating, and safe-stop**, not to redefine doctrine.

---

## A.2 Canonical Anchor Terms (brief)
This annex assumes the reader has access to:
- **B-VSS™ — Bounded, Versioned System State** (receipt-first state object).  
- **STS™ / SCS™ / MCS™** (Chapter 42 scoring primitives).  
- **Min-Gate Law** (non-compensatory pass/fail).  
- **CT™ — Consequence Tier** (Chapter 44 enforcement scale).  
- **CHS™ — Coherence Health Score** (Chapter 43 operational maturity banding).  
- **HML™ — Human Mandate Layer** (human authority).  
- **TGF™ — Third Guardian Firewall™** (veto and containment).  
- **HSOD™ — High-Level System Operational Directive** (immediate safe-state).  
- **THT Protocol™ + EVL™** (receipt + epoch continuity).

---

## A.3 The Digestive Analogy (Strictly Bounded)

### A.3.1 Intake Hygiene (Mouth / Taste)
**Analogy:** early detection of contaminated or malformed intake.  
**TruthSeal meaning:** pre-validation of **B-VSS inputs** and receipt readiness.

**Sovereign constraint:** no intake proceeds without a valid capture path for **ts.snapshot.v[N]**.

---

### A.3.2 Decomposition & Structural Check (Stomach)
**Analogy:** breaking down input into assessable components.  
**TruthSeal meaning:** generation of scoring-relevant features for **STS™** and **SCS™**.

**Sovereign constraint:** **Min-Gate** supremacy applies before any aggregate reporting value.

---

### A.3.3 Absorption With Immunity (Small Intestine)
**Analogy:** selective absorption; pathogens rejected.  
**TruthSeal meaning:** only **receipt-clean, non-regressing** state updates may proceed.

**Sovereign constraint:** **LEI = 1** forbids regression from a known coherent state without **HML™** mandate and a new receipt.

---

### A.3.4 Control & Resource Routing (Pancreas / Liver)
**Analogy:** controlled release of enzymes and filters.  
**TruthSeal meaning:** controlled activation of governance tools and policy contracts.

**Sovereign constraint:** routing must remain subordinate to **HML™ authority** and **TGF™ veto paths**.

---

### A.3.5 Consolidation & Pruning (Large Intestine)
**Analogy:** consolidation of value; removal of waste.  
**TruthSeal meaning:** lawful reduction of redundant state under receipt continuity.

**Sovereign constraint:** deletion, pruning, or compression requires **audit-contiguous receipts** and an **EVL™ trail**.

---

## A.4 The Analogy-to-Enforcement Bridge

### A.4.1 Non-Compensatory Law
The digestive metaphor must never imply compensatory safety.  
In TruthSeal™, a single critical failure **overrides** all aggregate strength.

**Rule:**  
If any critical factor breaches **Min-Gate**, the system assigns a **CT™** consequence regardless of **MCS™**.

---

### A.4.2 Consequence and Health Are Distinct
**CT™** is the **operational consequence scale** derived from integrity severity.  
**CHS™** is the **operational maturity band** that governs delegated autonomy.

**Rule:**  
**CT drives CHS down-banding.**  
CHS does not generate CT.

---

### A.4.3 Immediate Safe-State Reflex
**Analogy:** protective reflex preventing systemic injury.  
**TruthSeal meaning:** **HSOD™** triggers the immediate safe-state when a critical threshold is crossed.

**Rule:**  
A **CT-4** event mandates **HSOD™ safe-state** execution via the **TGF™** veto path pending **HML™** review.

---

## A.5 Canonical Statement
This annex exists to improve reader understanding of sequence and protection logic.  
The authoritative operational reality remains:

**B-VSS capture → STS/SCS scoring → Min-Gate verdict → CT assignment → CHS enforcement → HSOD safe-state when required**,  
with all transitions sealed under **THT Protocol™** and historically continuous under **EVL™**.

---

## A.6 Editorial Boundary
This annex must remain:
- diplomatic,  
- non-sensational,  
- strictly subordinate to Chapters 42–45,  
- free of alternative metric naming that conflicts with established doctrine.
