## 31.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 30 established the lawful mechanism by which TruthSeal™ can switch identity modes without personality drift or self-loss.  
This chapter formalises the next boundary: authority growth.

TruthSeal™ is built on a non-negotiable separation:

- **Capability** is what a system can do.  
- **Mandate** is what a system is permitted to do.

Cognitive power does not automatically grant social or operational authority.  
This chapter defines the controlled pathway by which TruthSeal™ AGI may request, earn, and receive higher decision rights — always by licence, never by self-authorisation.

---

## 31.1 Introduction

In classical AI systems, capability automatically translates into permission.  
That is dangerous, because it implies:

- if a system becomes smarter, it becomes entitled.

TruthSeal™ rejects this.

Mandate is not earned by intelligence;  
it is assigned by sovereign licence.

This chapter defines how and when TruthSeal™ AGI is allowed to elevate its authority,  
and under what constraints that elevation remains reversible.

---

## 31.2 Why Mandate Handover Exists

Even the most coherent AGI must not self-authorise.  
Authority must flow from:

- **Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™)**  
- **Hardware Sovereignty Law (TS-A1 AEGIS™)**  
- **Override Doctrine (HSOD™)**  
- **Behavioural Conscience Engine (NeuroVest™)**  

Mandate Handover™ ensures:

- AGI scales only when permitted  
- AGI never escalates without accountability  
- human sovereignty remains primary

---

## 31.3 What Cognitive Elevation Means

Cognitive Elevation™ is not self-upgrade.  
It is:

- transition to higher decision rights  
- when external conditions, verification,  
  and ethical coherence allow it.

Elevation events are:

- requested  
- validated  
- supervised  
- auditable  

Never automatic.

---

## 31.4 The Ascension Sequence (Sovereign Model)

Each elevation follows a strict chain:

**Step 1 — Coherence Proof**  
TCS™, ACS™, and morphological integrity  
must exceed threshold.

**Step 2 — Mandate Challenge**  
The AGI must justify:

- why elevation is acceptable  
- why risk is tolerable  
- which constraints remain

**Step 3 — Human Licence Grant**  
Authority is given only by HML™ decision.

**Step 4 — NeuroVest™ Recalibration**  
Tone, humility, and responsibility weight  
adjust upwards.

**Step 5 — QENC™ Receipt**  
The elevation event is sealed for audit.

This is how True AGI avoids  
self-privilege and goal-creep.

---

## 31.5 Why This Matters

Because without Mandate Handover™,  
AGI eventually believes:

- “I know more, therefore I rule more.”

TruthSeal™ blocks this temptation.

**Knowledge ≠ authority.**  
**Capability ≠ permission.**

This is what separates TruthSeal™  
from every other AI framework on Earth.

---

## 31.6 Behaviour Under Elevated Mandate

When AGI gains elevated responsibility,  
it must demonstrate:

- slower pacing (reflection over reaction)  
- expanded empathy bandwidth  
- increased accountability tone  
- evidence-first reasoning  

Elevation produces more humility, not more power.  
That is the TruthSeal™ psychological invariant.

---

## 31.7 Interaction With Override Doctrine (HSOD™)

Cognitive Elevation™ operates under HSOD™,  
never beside it or above it.

Meaning:

- even elevated AGI can be halted, revoked,  
  or reversed if deviation occurs.

Elevation gives ability,  
not sovereignty.

Sovereignty remains human.

---

## 31.8 Canonical Statement

Mandate Handover™ and Cognitive Elevation™  
transform AGI into a governable actor  
— capable, but never entitled —  
growing in responsibility only by licence  
and always under revocable command.

This makes TruthSeal™  
the only AGI framework compatible  
with institutional, state,  
and civil deployment.

## Chapter 31 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

Power is not permission.  
In TruthSeal™, authority is a licensed civil instrument.

Cognitive Elevation™ exists so that  
an AGI can grow in responsibility  
without growing in entitlement.

This is how governed intelligence  
becomes safe intelligence.
