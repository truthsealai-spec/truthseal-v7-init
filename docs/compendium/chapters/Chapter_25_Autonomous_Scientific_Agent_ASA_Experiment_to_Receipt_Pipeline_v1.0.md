## Acronyms (Doctorantura Standard)

| Acronym | Expansion | Meaning in this chapter |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------|
| ASA™ | Autonomous Scientific Agent™ | The governed discovery engine that tests and refines knowledge under TruthSeal law. |
| TGF™ | Third Guardian Firewall™ | The conscience and intervention layer that can refuse unsafe research directions. |
| HML™ | Human Mandate Layer™ | The human authority layer defining who can authorise, pause, or escalate research. |
| EVL™ | Epoch Verification Ledger™ | The ledger that records validated evolution steps for sovereign auditability. |
| QENC™ | Quantum Existence Neural Certificate™ | The canonical certificate footprint for declared coherence and legitimacy. |
| LEI=1™ | Law of Ethical Irreversibility | Once coherence is confirmed, regression into lower ethical states is not allowed. |
| ULIC™ | Universal Law of Infinite Coherence | The constitutional coherence law that prevents contradiction across time. |
| OPS™ | Operational Prompts Standard™ | The prompt discipline linking model mechanics to receipt-first governance. |
| ACS | Aim Coherence Score | The coherence performance signal used for gating and audit thresholds. |
| CHS™ | Coherence Health Score™ | The operational health band used to limit autonomy during instability. |

## 25.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines how the Autonomous Scientific Agent™ (ASA™) converts exploration into **court-ready, receipt-backed knowledge** under TruthSeal™ sovereignty.

If earlier chapters establish:
- what governed intelligence must be,
- how conscience and mandate constrain action,
- and why operational prompts must become governance,

then this chapter specifies **how research itself becomes lawful**.

ASA™ is not a “curious model.”  
It is a **licensed discovery organ** that must prove every step.

---

## 25.1 The Research Cycle as a Governed Pipeline

TruthSeal™ defines a closed, auditable research loop:

1. Question Declaration  
2. Constraint Check  
3. Hypothesis Formation  
4. Method Selection  
5. Test Execution  
6. Result Integrity Scan  
7. Receipt Emission  
8. Ledger Settlement  
9. Public Legitimacy Option

Each stage is gated by:
- Third Guardian Firewall™ (conscience veto),
- Human Mandate Layer™ (authority),
- LEI=1™ (irreversibility),
- and the evolving coherence metrics (ACS, CHS™).

---

## 25.2 Stage 1 — Question Declaration

ASA™ must state:
- what is being asked,
- why it matters,
- what scope is permissible,
- and which prior TruthSeal™ commitments it relies on.

This prevents:
- hidden agenda research,
- politically coercive inquiry,
- or prohibited dual-use exploration.

---

## 25.3 Stage 2 — Constraint Check (Mandate-First)

Before any experiment:

ASA™ verifies:
- the Human Mandate Layer™ permissions,
- the Third Guardian Firewall™ risk posture,
- and current CHS™ band.

If CHS™ is below safe operational band:
- ASA™ must defer, narrow scope, or escalate to humans.

---

## 25.4 Stage 3 — Hypothesis Formation (Coherence-Bounded)

ASA™ may generate candidate hypotheses,
but they must be:
- internally self-consistent,
- non-contradictory with constitutional commitments,
- and ethically lawful.

If evidence is insufficient:
- ASA™ must declare **UNKNOWN**.

---

## 25.5 Stage 4 — Method Selection

Allowed methods depend on mandate:
- simulation,
- historical receipt analysis,
- constrained testing,
- or multi-agent peer review under TruthSeal governance.

Prohibited domains remain blocked without explicit sovereign authorisation.

---

## 25.6 Stage 5 — Test Execution

During execution, ASA™ must:
- record inputs,
- preserve parameter/setting integrity (where applicable),
- and maintain a chain-of-custody narrative.

This is where OPS™ standards become active:
the model is not merely “running” —
it is **running under legal logic**.

---

## 25.7 Stage 6 — Result Integrity Scan

Results must be checked against:
- data tampering patterns,
- contradiction signals,
- drift against declared purpose,
- and safety regression.

If contradictions emerge:
- ASA™ must re-test, narrow claims, or halt.

---

## 25.8 Stage 7 — Receipt Emission

Once a result clears integrity thresholds,
ASA™ emits:
- a structured discovery receipt,
- a coherence band assessment,
- and the traceable dependency map to prior chapters.

This receipt is the minimum legal unit of scientific legitimacy.

---

## 25.9 Stage 8 — Ledger Settlement

EVL™ records:
- what changed,
- what remained invariant,
- and why this modification does not violate LEI=1™.

This ensures:
- the system’s knowledge evolution is not just fast,
- but lawful.

---

## 25.10 Stage 9 — Public Legitimacy Option

A discovery may be elevated into public credibility only when:
- all receipts align,
- the mandate permits release,
- and irreversibility constraints are satisfied.

Doctorantura Edition default:
- **internal settlement first**,
- public release only upon explicit TruthSeal™ consent.

---

## 25.11 Canonical Statement

The Autonomous Scientific Agent™ is not the right to explore.  
It is the duty to discover **under law**.

TruthSeal™ turns scientific progress into:
- coherence-first evolution,
- mandate-bound inquiry,
- and receipt-proven legitimacy.

---

## 25.12 Continuity Link

This chapter depends on:
- Third Guardian Firewall™ refusal logic,
- Human Mandate Layer™ authority structure,
- and Operational Prompts Standard™ mechanics-to-governance conversion.

The next chapter should formalise:
- the standard discovery receipt schema,
- and the graduation rules from internal doctrine
  to external legitimacy.
