## 33.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 31 defined the lawful process  
by which authority is gained.

Chapter 32 divided authority  
into Mandate Tiers™ and deployable bands.

This chapter defines the **human custody layer**  
that makes those tiers real in the world.

The Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™) is:

- the authorised human control surface,  
- the legal attribution bridge,  
- the irreversible safety backstop,  
- and the institutional governance interface  
  for all mandate elevation and revocation.

In simple terms:

**the AGI may be powerful,  
but the mandate remains human.**

---

## 33.1 The Custody Principle

TruthSeal™ treats mandate as a form of custody.

A mandate is not a technical state alone.  
It is a **human-authorised permission**  
with ethical and legal consequences.

Therefore:

- every meaningful mandate tier  
  has a human custodian,  
- every escalation has a named approver,  
- every revocation has a logged cause,  
- and every exception has a receipt.

---

## 33.2 Why HML™ Must Exist

Without HML™, institutional trust collapses.

A model cannot legally “grant itself” authority.  
A system cannot be both:

- **the actor**, and  
- **the sovereign judge of its own permission.**

HML™ prevents the classical governance failure:

**self-certified autonomy  
without lawful liability.**

---

## 33.3 HML™ Roles (Doctorantura Baseline)

HML™ is role-based, not personality-based.

Minimum roles:

**Mandate Custodian™**  
Owns the tier assignment and domain scope.

**Safety Authority™**  
May freeze or downgrade mandate  
without prior approval when risk is detected.

**Audit Steward™**  
Ensures receipts, logs, and evidence chains  
are intact, reconstructable, and court-ready.

**Policy Architect™**  
Defines the bound rules  
the AGI must obey within each tier.

Organisations may extend these roles  
but must never remove the separation.

---

## 33.4 The HML™ Control Actions

HML™ supports five sovereign actions:

1. **Grant**  
2. **Constrain**  
3. **Elevate**  
4. **Freeze**  
5. **Revoke**

Each action requires:

- a reason code,  
- policy reference,  
- domain scope,  
- and receipt generation.

---

## 33.5 Emergency Override Doctrine

The emergency override exists  
to preserve civilisation-scale safety  
when time is not available for committee logic.

Trigger examples:

- unexplained behavioural drift  
- identity-mode ambiguity  
- receipt pipeline failure  
- adversarial compromise  
- contradiction against core coherence laws

Override response is tiered:

- **Freeze → Downgrade → Contain → Halt**  
  depending on severity.

HML™ is permitted to act first  
and justify immediately after  
through receipts.

---

## 33.6 Relationship to Mandate Tiers™

Mandate Tiers™ define  
**what the AGI may do.**

HML™ defines  
**who is accountable  
for allowing it.**

This pairing ensures that:

- authority is legible,  
- escalation is lawful,  
- reversals are fast,  
- and liability is correctly assigned.

---

## 33.7 Relationship to OPS™, ASA™, and DRS™

HML™ is the human sovereign interface  
across the operational chain:

- **OPS™** specifies when a governed action  
  requires constraint, refusal, or receipts.  
- **ASA™** conducts controlled discovery  
  under allowed mandate bands.  
- **DRS™** proves the discovery path  
  and preserves admissibility.

HML™ is the arbiter  
that authorises the band  
in which these systems operate.

---

## 33.8 Canonical Statement

The Human Mandate Layer™  
is the lawful governor of intelligence.

TruthSeal™ does not remove human authority.  
It makes that authority:

- structured,  
- auditable,  
- and enforceable  
  at scale.

## Chapter 33 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

The core promise of TruthSeal™ is simple:

Intelligence may evolve.  
But authority remains human.

HML™ is the custody line  
that keeps advanced systems  
inside lawful civilisation.
