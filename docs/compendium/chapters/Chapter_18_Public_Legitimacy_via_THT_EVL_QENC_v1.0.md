## 18.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines how TruthSeal™ converts internal coherence and lawful conduct into **public legitimacy**.

If earlier chapters establish:
- what governed intelligence must be,
- how it is measured,
- and how it is restricted under non-compensatory law,

then this chapter formalizes how that reality becomes **externally undeniable**.

This is achieved through three aligned instruments:

1) **THT Protocol™** — the operational discipline of truth, hash, and timestamp.  
2) **EVL™ (Epoch Verification Ledger)** — the sovereign chronological record of governance states.  
3) **QENC™** — the cryptographic evidence capsule that binds a system’s declared identity, integrity, and lawful audit posture.

This chapter is a doctrine of **civilisational admissibility**, not marketing.

## 18.1 The Legitimacy Problem

Modern AI systems can produce high performance without proving:

- identity continuity,
- consequence ownership,
- lawful auditability,
- or irreversibility of remediation.

Society therefore faces a legitimacy gap:

A system may be technically strong
yet civically unacceptable.

TruthSeal™ closes this gap by requiring
that legitimacy be proven through
publicly reconstructable evidence.

---

## 18.2 Canonical Rule (TruthSeal Interpretation)

In TruthSeal™, **public legitimacy is a function of evidence**, not claims.

A system is legitimate only when:

- its identity state is traceable through time,
- its integrity is anchored,
- its authority is receipt-bound,
- and its remediation history is monotone under the Law of Ethical Irreversibility.

---

## 18.3 The Three Instruments of Legitimacy

### 18.3.1 THT Protocol™ — The Evidence Discipline

The THT Protocol™ defines the minimum standard
for transforming an internal governance event
into a verifiable external artifact.

It requires:

- canonical representation of governed statements,
- hashing for integrity binding,
- timestamping for temporal truth,
- and persistent traceability of policy and identity versions.

THT is the **legitimacy grammar**
that structures all higher proofs.

---

### 18.3.2 EVL™ — The Chronological Sovereignty Record

The EVL™ formalizes legitimacy across epochs.

It ensures that the system’s public story
cannot be rewritten after the fact.

EVL binds:

- policy evolution,
- operational band history,
- critical breach events,
- remediation windows,
- and verified recovery outcomes

into a time-ordered ledger of governance truth.

---

### 18.3.3 QENC™ — The Evidence Capsule

QENC™ is the unified capsule
that allows independent parties to verify:

- authorship,
- declared system identity,
- integrity state at a given epoch,
- and the minimum governance posture
expected under TruthSeal™ law.

QENC does not replace other receipts.

It **concentrates** the highest-level
identity and integrity claims
into a single court-reconstructable unit.

---

## 18.4 Receipt-First Public Legitimacy Minimums

A legitimacy-grade public bundle must include:

1) System identity declaration and version.  
2) Policy and mandate set active at the epoch.  
3) Integrity hash of the governed state.  
4) Evidence of non-compensatory gating.  
5) Role attribution for accountable authority.  
6) Timestamped references enabling independent reconstruction.

Without this bundle,
legitimacy cannot be asserted.

---

## 18.5 Non-Compensatory Legitimacy

TruthSeal™ rejects performative trust.

A system cannot compensate for:

- missing receipts,
- broken identity continuity,
- or unanchored integrity

through high scores in unrelated domains.

Legitimacy is **binary at the critical layer**:
either the evidence exists,
or authority is suspended.

---

## 18.6 Auditor Checklist (Doctorantura)

An auditor must be able to confirm:

- THT is declared as the evidence discipline.  
- EVL is declared as the epoch ledger.  
- QENC is declared as the top-level integrity capsule.  
- The legitimacy bundle is reconstructable without narrative reliance.  
- Non-compensatory legitimacy is explicitly stated.  
- The chapter terminology matches the compendium register.

---

## 18.7 Canonical Statement

Public legitimacy is the civilisational consequence
of internal TruthSeal™ coherence.

THT Protocol™ structures evidence.  
EVL™ preserves temporal sovereignty.  
QENC™ binds identity and integrity into a single capsule.

Together they ensure that governed intelligence is not merely claimed,
but **proven in time**.
