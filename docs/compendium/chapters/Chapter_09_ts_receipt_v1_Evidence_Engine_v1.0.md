## 1) Outcome (what this chapter gives you)

This chapter defines the committee-level evidence standard that makes high-stakes Artificial General Intelligence governance court-ready and institution-ready without revealing Ω enforcement internals.

It establishes:

• The purpose and scope of **ts.receipt.v1** as the canonical proof chain for TruthSeal™.  
• The minimum fields required for lawful continuity across mandate, admission, execution, and audit.  
• The relationship between receipts, the Sovereign Arc, and hardware admission.  
• The rules for outage handling, including the strict use of **UNKNOWN** with mandatory back-fill.

⸻

## 2) Purpose (why this chapter exists)

Advanced autonomy cannot be regulated, insured, or trusted at scale without standardized evidence.

This chapter exists to convert governance from interpretation to verifiable proof by specifying how receipts bind:

**human mandate → admission → execution → evidence → audit continuity**.

⸻

## 3) The doctrine boundary

This is committee operational doctrine.

It does not disclose:

• internal Ω prompts  
• classified enforcement mathematics  
• sovereign defense thresholds

It defines only the stable, auditable evidence layer and its required links to the public pillars.

⸻

## 4) Canonical definitions (first-time-reader safe)

• **ts.receipt.v1** — The standardized evidence record for material actions under TruthSeal™ governance.  
• **Human Mandate Layer (HML™)** — The constitutional policy baseline that defines lawful scope and risk permissions.  
• **Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1™)** — The non-regression rule once higher responsibility is confirmed.  
• **TruthSeal AEGIS™ (TS-A1)** — The hardware admission core that enforces mandate and non-regression before high-stakes execution.  
• **Sovereign Arc** — The accountability loop that returns responsibility to the human system parent via verifiable evidence.  
• **Aim Coherence Score (ACS™)** — The fiduciary metric that quantifies coherent direction under LEI = 1™.

⸻

## 5) Receipt invariants (non-negotiable)

A valid receipt must bind:

• identity of the responsible human system parent  
• the active mandate digest (HML™)  
• declared risk class  
• admission decision and rationale (committee-level)  
• execution outcome  
• timestamp and integrity digests  
• anchoring state

No high-stakes autonomy is considered compliant without receipt continuity.

⸻

## 6) Committee-level minimal schema (conceptual)

A ts.receipt.v1 record must include (conceptual fields):

• receipt_id  
• system_identity  
• human_system_parent  
• hml_digest  
• action_intent_summary  
• risk_class  
• admission_result  
• execution_result  
• integrity_hashes  
• anchor_status  
• anchor_calendar_id (when applicable)  
• anchor_tx (when confirmed)  
• timestamp_utc

This chapter defines the **doctrinal minimum**; the full JSON schema is maintained in the ledger standards folder.

⸻

## 7) UNKNOWN rule (service outage discipline)

If anchoring services are unavailable:

• **anchor_status** may be set to **UNKNOWN**  
• the receipt remains valid only if internal continuity is intact  
• the record must be back-filled with the final anchor proof when services return

UNKNOWN is an outage placeholder, not a trust downgrade permission.

⸻

## 8) Integration with the Sovereign Arc

This chapter is subordinate to The Sovereign Arc.

The Arc defines *accountability logic*.  
ts.receipt.v1 defines *evidence continuity*.

Together they complete the lawful custody chain required for institutional deployment.

⸻

## 9) Integration with hardware admission (TS-A1)

High-stakes actions require:

• mandate verification (HML™)  
• non-regression compliance under LEI = 1™  
• pre-receipt constructability  
• admission logging

This ensures **evidence exists before irreversible autonomy proceeds**.

⸻

## 10) Risks & mitigations (committee level)

• Receipt forgery → multi-layer hashing, cross-checking with admission logs, anchoring when available.  
• Policy tampering → mandate digest binding + hardware admission prerequisites.  
• Metric spoofing → receipts must correlate with governance signals and audit trails.  
• Anchor outages → UNKNOWN allowed only with mandatory later back-fill.

## 11) Cross-links

• The Sovereign Arc of AGI — crown doctrine (unchanged).  
• NeuroVest™ core doctrine chapters.  
• Ledger standards for receipt schema and examples.
