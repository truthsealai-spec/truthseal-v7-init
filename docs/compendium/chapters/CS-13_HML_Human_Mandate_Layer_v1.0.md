## 1) Outcome (what this chapter gives you)

This chapter defines the **Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™)** as the constitutional custody system for governed intelligence.

It clarifies, at committee-operational level:

• who may **own**, **command**, **supervise**, **override**, and **audit** systems under TruthSeal™  
• how authority is **proven**, **limited**, and **logged**  
• how liability remains **human-anchored** across TS-A1™, NeuroVest™, TS-R1™, and TS-R2™

This chapter avoids repeating hardware or robotics doctrine already defined elsewhere; it focuses on **human authority, legal custody, and command legitimacy**.

⸻

## 2) Purpose (why this chapter exists)

Advanced AI and embodied agents can only be deployed at scale if responsibility remains **assignable**.

Without HML™:

• mandate becomes ambiguous  
• liability becomes disputable  
• sovereignty risks drifting from institutions to machines

HML™ prevents that drift by binding every significant instruction to a **named, authenticated, jurisdiction-bound human or institution**.

⸻

## 3) Doctrine boundary

This is committee operational doctrine.

It defines HML™ in terms of:

• enforceable authority roles  
• identity requirements  
• command accept/reject logic  
• audit visibility

It does not disclose:

• classified Ω enforcement mechanics  
• internal deployment thresholds  
• sealed control mathematics reserved for Doctorantura

⸻

## 4) Position in the stack

HML™ sits above the TruthSeal governance stack:

• **TS-A1 AEGIS™** governs computation admission and lawful execution.  
• **NeuroVest™** governs behavioural discipline, memory, and consequence continuity.  
• **TS-R1™** governs single-agent physical sovereignty.  
• **TS-R2™** governs swarm/fleet sovereignty.  
• **TCS™, ACS™, CHS™** provide institutional-grade coherence, aim, and operational health signals.

HML™ defines **who is allowed to instruct, override, and answer** for every layer.

No TruthSeal™ deployment is complete without a defined HML™.

⸻

## 5) Core roles (authority map)

HML™ recognises four primary human roles:

1) **Owner / Sovereign Principal**  
Legal holder of ultimate authority and liability for a system or fleet.

2) **Guardian**  
Appointed party responsible for safety standards, configuration integrity, and CHS™ policy adherence.

3) **Operator**  
Individual permitted to issue direct commands within defined scope and CHS™ limits.

4) **Auditor / Regulator**  
Legally empowered entity entitled to inspect receipts, relevant EVL™ records, and QENC™ ProofCapsules.

Every command, override, or configuration change must be traceable to one or more of these roles.

⸻

## 6) Identity and authentication

HML™ requires each role to be bound to:

• a verified person or institution  
• an authenticated channel (keys, credentials, hardware token, or equivalent)  
• jurisdiction and legal contact metadata

**Anonymous control is not permitted.**

If identity cannot be established at the required assurance level,  
TS-A1/TS-R1/TS-R2 must treat the instruction as invalid and generate a rejected-command receipt.

⸻

## 7) Rights (what each role may do)

• **Owner / Sovereign Principal**  
  - define policy envelopes  
  - set CHS™ ceilings  
  - approve or revoke deployment  
  - appoint or revoke Guardians and Operators

• **Guardian**  
  - adjust operational parameters within Owner-defined boundaries  
  - request CHS™ upgrades/downgrades  
  - approve updates to NeuroVest™ profiles  
  - initiate safe-stop or shutdown

• **Operator**  
  - issue task-level commands within CHS™ limits  
  - request clarification  
  - trigger local emergency safe-stop where immediate danger is perceived

• **Auditor / Regulator**  
  - access lawful logs/receipts  
  - demand explanations  
  - require corrective plans under applicable law

Rights are conditional and remain valid only while identity, jurisdiction, and CHS™ rules are satisfied.

⸻

## 8) Duties and liabilities

HML™ does not grant power without responsibility:

• **Owner** accepts ultimate civil and, where applicable, criminal liability for deployment and mandate scope.  
• **Guardian** is responsible for configuration integrity, safety posture, and correct CHS™ banding.  
• **Operator** must follow operational standards, refuse unsafe instructions, and report anomalies.  
• **Auditor / Regulator** must handle receipt data lawfully and avoid abuse of forensic insight.

TruthSeal™ makes these duties **ledger-visible**.

⸻

## 9) CHS™ authority binding (no repetition, clear mapping)

HML™ binds authority to CHS™ bands enforced by TS-A1/TS-R1/TS-R2:

• **CHS/L (Low)**  
  - system is in safe-stop or restricted state  
  - only Owner or Guardian may authorise resumption after review  
  - Operators are limited to emergency safe-stop and reporting

• **CHS/M (Medium)**  
  - Operators may command within a restricted playbook  
  - elevated-risk tasks require Guardian or Owner confirmation

• **CHS/H (High)**  
  - Operators gain routine authority  
  - high-energy, high-speed, medical, financial, or public-risk actions remain gated by higher-tier confirmation

• **CHS/UH (Ultra-High)**  
  - autonomy windows expand only with proven stability and ledger history  
  - HML™ retains absolute revocation power  
  - a single Owner/authority instruction can down-band and force safe-stop

Robotic layers must enforce these rules in control systems, not on paper.

⸻

## 10) Command accept / reject logic

Every instruction passes a simple decision chain:

1) **Who issued the command?** (identity + role)  
2) **Is this role authorised at the current CHS™ level?**  
3) **Is the action allowed in the current context?**  
4) **Does it violate governing TruthSeal laws and policy?**

If any condition fails, the system must reject or degrade the command and issue a receipt stating:

• issuer role identity  
• reason for rejection  
• current CHS™ band  
• time and mandate reference

This protects both the human authority and the operational environment.

⸻

## 11) Override and emergency powers

HML™ defines three override paths:

• **Soft Override (Guardian / Owner)**  
  - CHS™ down-band  
  - suspend specific behaviours  
  - schedule review

• **Hard Override (Owner or authorised authority)**  
  - immediate safe-stop  
  - isolation from networks  
  - freeze of fleet coordination where applicable

• **Regulatory Override (Auditor / Regulator)**  
  - lawful mandate to require shutdown or configuration changes  
  - recorded as an external legal-override event

NeuroVest™ and TS-A1 must treat these as binding.

⸻

## 12) Receipts and legal interface

HML™ ensures that every significant human–system interaction is receipted:

• role identity  
• time  
• command or override  
• outcome (accepted / rejected / degraded)  
• CHS™ state before and after

These entries appear in EVL™ and may be consolidated into QENC™ ProofCapsules  
when long-term sovereign evidence is required.

⸻

## 13) Canonical statement

The Human Mandate Layer™ is the TruthSeal™ construct that fixes sovereignty in human and institutional hands.

It specifies:

• who may command  
• who must answer  
• how authority is verified  
• how that relationship is recorded and enforced across hardware, software, and robotics

Without HML™, sovereignty would drift toward machines.  
With HML™, every intelligent system remains anchored to named, accountable human authority.
