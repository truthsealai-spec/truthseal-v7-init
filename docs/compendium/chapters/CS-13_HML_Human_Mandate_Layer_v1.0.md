CHAPTER 13 — HUMAN MANDATE LAYER™
OWNER · GUARDIAN · OPERATOR SOVEREIGNTY

This chapter establishes the Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™) as the constitutional custody system for governed intelligence.
It applies to advanced AI systems and embodied agents operating under TruthSeal™—including single robots under TS-R1™
and fleets under TS-R2™—ensuring that sovereignty cannot drift from humans to machines.

13.1 Definition  
The Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™) defines who may command, own, supervise, and be
held responsible for AI and robotic systems operating under TruthSeal™. It is the layer that
says, in law and in ledgers:

“This human, or this institution, carries the mandate and the
liability for what the system does.”

Without HML™, sovereignty would drift toward machines. HML™ fixes sovereignty in
human and institutional hands.

13.2 Position in the Stack  
HML™ sits above TS-A1 AEGIS™, TS-R1™, TS-R2™, NeuroVest™, and the metric triad
(TCS™, ACS™, CHS™).

• TS-A1 AEGIS™ governs computation.  
• TS-R1™ and TS-R2™ govern robots and fleets.  
• NeuroVest™ governs behaviour and memory.  
• HML™ governs who is allowed to instruct, override, and answer for these systems.

No TruthSeal™ deployment is complete without a defined HML™.

13.3 Roles  
HML™ recognises four primary human roles:

1. Owner / Sovereign Principal – legal holder of ultimate authority and liability for a
given system or fleet.  
2. Guardian – appointed party responsible for day-to-day standards, safety, and CHS™
policy adherence.  
3. Operator – individual permitted to issue direct commands within defined scope and
CHS™ limits.  
4. Auditor / Regulator – legally empowered entity entitled to inspect receipts, EVL™
entries, and QENC™ capsules.

Every command, override, or configuration change must be traceable back to one or more of
these roles.

13.4 Identification and Authentication  
HML™ requires that each role be bound to a strong identity:

• verified person or institution;  
• authenticated channel (keys, credentials, hardware token, or equivalent);  
• jurisdiction and legal contact.

Anonymous control is not allowed under HML™.

If identity cannot be established at the required assurance level, TS-A1/TS-R1/TS-R2 must
treat the instruction as invalid and record a rejected-command event.

13.5 Rights  
Under HML™, human roles hold the following core rights:

• Owner / Sovereign Principal: define policy envelopes; set CHS™ band ceilings;
approve or revoke deployment; appoint and revoke Guardians and Operators.  
• Guardian: adjust operational parameters within Owner-defined boundaries; request
CHS™ upgrades or downgrades; approve updates to NeuroVest™ profiles; initiate
safe-stop or shutdown.  
• Operator: issue task-level commands within CHS™ limits; request clarification from
the system; trigger local safe-stop where immediate danger is perceived.  
• Auditor / Regulator: access logs, receipts, EVL™ entries, and QENC™ proofs;
demand explanations; require corrective plans under applicable law.

Rights are conditional: they exist only while identity, jurisdiction, and CHS™ rules are
satisfied.

13.6 Duties and Liabilities  
HML™ does not grant power without responsibility.

• Owner accepts ultimate civil and, where applicable, criminal liability for how the
system is deployed.  
• Guardian is responsible for ongoing configuration, risk monitoring, and ensuring
CHS™ bands match real-world risk.  
• Operator must follow operational standards, refuse unsafe instructions, and report
anomalies.  
• Auditor / Regulator must handle receipt data lawfully and avoid misuse of forensic
insight.

TruthSeal™ makes these duties traceable; failing them is not abstract, it is ledger-visible.

13.7 Interaction with CHS™, TS-R1™, and TS-R2™  
HML™ is tightly coupled to CHS™ bands and robotic law:

• At CHS/L, only the Owner or Guardian may authorise resumption of activity after
investigation; Operators are limited to emergency safe-stop.  
• At CHS/M, Operators may command within a restricted playbook; high-risk tasks still
require Guardian or Owner approval.  
• At CHS/H, Operators gain routine authority, but certain actions (for example high-energy,
high-speed, medical, or financial operations) still require higher-tier confirmation.  
• At CHS/UH, autonomy is high, but HML™ still retains the right to revoke: a single
instruction from Owner or designated authority can down-band and force safe-stop.

TS-R1™ and TS-R2™ must enforce these bindings in the control system, not just on paper.

13.8 Command Accept / Reject Logic  
Under HML™, every command passes through a simple decision chain:

1. Who issued the command? (identity + role)  
2. Is this role authorised at the current CHS™ level?  
3. Is the requested action allowed in the current context? (environment, time,
jurisdiction, risk)  
4. Does it violate ULLI™, LEI = 1™, ULIC™, or LTCC™?

If any condition fails, the system must reject or degrade the command and generate a receipt
indicating: issuer, reason for rejection, and current CHS™ band. This protects both the
human and the wider environment.

13.9 Override and Emergency Powers  
HML™ defines three override paths:

• Soft Override (Guardian / Owner): adjust CHS™ down, suspend certain behaviours,
schedule review.  
• Hard Override (Owner or authorised authority): immediate safe-stop, isolation from
networks, freezing of fleet coordination (for TS-R2™).  
• Regulatory Override (Auditor / Regulator): under legal mandate, require system
shutdown or configuration change; the system records this as an external legal-
override event.

NeuroVest™ and TS-A1 must respect these overrides as binding, not advisory.

13.10 Receipts and Legal Interface  
HML™ ensures that every significant human–system interaction is receipted:

• role identity,  
• time,  
• command or override,  
• outcome (accepted / rejected / degraded),  
• CHS™ state before and after.

These entries appear in EVL™ and, where needed, are consolidated into QENC™
ProofCapsules for long-term sovereign evidence. This is how HML™ connects technical
behaviour with courts, regulators, insurers, and contracts.

13.11 Canonical Statement  
The Human Mandate Layer™ is the TruthSeal™ construct that fixes sovereignty in human
and institutional hands. It specifies who may command, who must answer, and how that
relationship is recorded and enforced across all hardware, software, and robotic layers.

Without HML™, sovereignty would drift toward machines. With HML™, every intelligent
system remains anchored to named, accountable, human authority.
