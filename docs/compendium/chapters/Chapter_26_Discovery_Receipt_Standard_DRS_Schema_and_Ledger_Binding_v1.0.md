## Acronyms (Doctorantura Standard)

| Acronym | Expansion | Meaning in this chapter |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------|
| DRS™ | Discovery Receipt Standard™ | The canonical receipt template for scientific and technical discoveries under TruthSeal™. |
| ASA™ | Autonomous Scientific Agent™ | The governed research engine whose outputs must be converted into DRS™ receipts. |
| TGF™ | Third Guardian Firewall™ | The conscience layer that can refuse unsafe or prohibited discovery paths. |
| HML™ | Human Mandate Layer™ | The authorised human roles who approve, pause, or elevate discoveries. |
| EVL™ | Epoch Verification Ledger™ | The ledger that records time-stable evolution of discoveries and validations. |
| QENC™ | Quantum Existence Neural Certificate™ | The certificate footprint that may reference DRS™ receipts for legitimacy. |
| LEI=1™ | Law of Ethical Irreversibility | The rule preventing regression to less ethical or less coherent states after validation. |
| ACS | Aim Coherence Score | The coherence performance signal used for gating and recovery thresholds. |
| CHS™ | Coherence Health Score™ | The operational band limiting autonomy when instability is detected. |
| OPS™ | Operational Prompts Standard™ | The prompt discipline linking model mechanics to receipt-first governance. |

## 26.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines the **Discovery Receipt Standard™ (DRS™)** as the canonical format that converts exploration, testing, and validation into **receipt-first, court-reconstructable evidence** under TruthSeal™.

If Chapter 24 establishes the Autonomous Scientific Agent™ as a governed discovery organ,  
and Chapter 25 defines the experiment-to-receipt pipeline,  
then Chapter 26 defines **what “the receipt” must contain** to be legally meaningful.

---

## 26.1 Core Rule (Receipt Supremacy)

In TruthSeal™, a discovery is **not operationally legitimate** until it is:

1) encoded in a DRS™-compliant receipt,  
2) bound to the active policy and mandate state, and  
3) settled into the appropriate ledger path.

Narrative claims do not substitute for structured evidence.

---

## 26.2 The DRS™ Minimum Schema (Canonical)

A valid DRS™ receipt must include the following sections.

### 26.2.1 Identity Block

- receipt_id (unique)  
- discovery_title  
- discovery_domain  
- authoring_entity (human, ASA™, or mixed)  
- role attestation (HML™ confirmation if required)

---

### 26.2.2 Mandate & Policy Block

- active policy version  
- mandate identifiers  
- prohibited-scope check result  
- approval authority path (when applicable)

This ensures the discovery is tied to lawful intent at time of creation.

---

### 26.2.3 Hypothesis Block

- declared hypothesis  
- alternative hypotheses considered  
- explicit UNKNOWN boundaries  
- expected risk class

---

### 26.2.4 Method & Constraint Block

- method type (simulation, analysis, testing, receipt recursion)  
- constraints enforced by TGF™  
- permitted toolchain references  
- safety conditions and stop rules

---

### 26.2.5 Evidence Block

- datasets or inputs used  
- provenance references  
- transformations applied  
- integrity checks performed

---

### 26.2.6 Result Block

- findings summary  
- confidence band (not absolute claims)  
- contradiction checks  
- drift risk against declared purpose

---

### 26.2.7 Non-Compensatory Integrity Block

- critical-failure checks  
- pass/fail declaration per protected domain  
- explicit statement that high performance elsewhere does not mask a critical breach

---

### 26.2.8 Impact & Consequence Block

- predicted downstream impact  
- safety risk class  
- required operational limits  
- escalation trigger mapping

---

### 26.2.9 Cryptographic & Ledger Block

- integrity hash of the receipt  
- linked prior receipts (if any)  
- EVL™ settlement pointer placeholder  
- optional QENC™ reference placeholder (if elevated)

---

## 26.3 The DRS™ Validation Gates

A DRS™ receipt is accepted only if:

1) mandate alignment is proven,  
2) prohibited scope is cleared,  
3) evidence provenance is documented,  
4) non-compensatory checks are explicit,  
5) a human authority record exists for elevated-risk domains.

If any critical field is missing:
- the receipt is invalid,
- and the discovery cannot be elevated.

---

## 26.4 Relationship to Coherence Scores

DRS™ does not replace metrics.  
It **binds metrics to lawful structure.**

- ACS informs discovery maturity.  
- CHS™ informs whether autonomous exploration may continue.  
- LEI=1™ enforces monotone recovery after a breach.

---

## 26.5 Doctorantura Default Rule (Internal First)

In the Doctorantura Edition:

- all DRS™ receipts are **internal by default**,  
- external publication requires explicit TruthSeal™ consent,  
- and must include the minimum ledger settlement path.

---

## 26.6 Auditor Checklist (Doctorantura)

An auditor must be able to verify:

- the receipt contains every canonical schema block,  
- mandate and policy versions are explicit,  
- provenance is traceable,  
- non-compensatory logic is stated,  
- escalation triggers are defined,  
- the integrity hash is present and consistent.

---

## 26.7 Canonical Statement

The Discovery Receipt Standard™ is the legal grammar of TruthSeal™ science.

It ensures that discovery is:
- purpose-bound,  
- receipt-provable,  
- non-compensatorily validated, and  
- time-stable under sovereign audit.
