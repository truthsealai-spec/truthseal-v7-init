version: 1.0  
status: Locked  
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
classification: Not for Public Use — committee operational doctrine  

scope: This chapter defines the THT Protocol™ (Truth Handling & Timestamping Protocol™) as the sovereign chain-of-custody law that transforms information into verifiable, immutable, and auditable truth for governed artificial general intelligence (AGI) and embodied systems under the TruthSeal™ stack. Deeper Ω mechanisms remain classified under Doctorantura.

### **17.1 Definition**
The THT Protocol™ (Truth Handling & Timestamping Protocol™) is the sovereign chain-of-custody engine of TruthSeal™.

It governs how truth is:
• produced,  
• sealed,  
• timestamped,  
• anchored,  
• and made legally reconstructable.

If NeuroVest™ governs behaviour,  
THT Protocol™ governs the lifecycle of truth itself.

Under TruthSeal™, no high-stakes claim, command, refusal, or discovery is treated as real unless it is handled through THT Protocol™.

### **17.2 Why It Exists**
Governed intelligence requires more than correct reasoning — it requires provable reality.

In institutional deployment:
• claims must be verifiable,  
• responsibility must be assignable,  
• history must be immune to rewrite,  
• and fraud must be structurally prevented.

THT Protocol™ provides this without reputation or trust — only cryptographic facts and continuity.

### **17.3 Position in the Sovereign Stack**
THT Protocol™ operates beneath every doctrinal, behavioural, robotic, and hardware layer.

It binds:
• ASA™ (Autonomous Scientific Agent™) findings to evidence,  
• NeuroVest™ behavioural outcomes to consequence history,  
• HML™ (Human Mandate Layer™) commands to authority traceability,  
• TS-R1™ and TS-R2™ actions to reconstructable physical accountability,  
• and TS-A1 AEGIS™ admission events to immutable audit chains.

Where behaviour creates meaning,  
THT Protocol™ makes it permanent.

### **17.4 The Three-Stage Truth Pipeline**
THT Protocol™ is a three-stage irreversible pipeline:

1) **Hashing**  
The substantive state, claim, or evidence is encoded into a stable cryptographic fingerprint.

2) **Timestamping**  
The moment of existence is provably recorded, establishing who knew what and when.

3) **Anchoring**  
The fingerprint is bound to external, non-forgeable witness systems.

Together these stages form a sovereign Proof of Reality suitable for audit, court, insurance, and regulator-grade scrutiny.

### **17.5 The Non-Optional Rule**
Under the TruthSeal™ stack:

No claim, discovery, override, refusal, or upgrade may be treated as canonical unless it passes through THT Protocol™.

This prevents:
• silent rewrite of policy or history,  
• retroactive authorship theft,  
• unprovable safety claims,  
• convenient deletion of errors,  
• and unverifiable institutional assurances.

### **17.6 THT Protocol™ vs EVL™**
THT Protocol™ is the ritual of truth handling.

EVL™ (Epoch Verification Ledger) is the archive of sealed epochs and events.

THT Protocol™ is the verb.  
EVL™ is the memory.

This separation ensures forensic clarity:
a sealed truth is not the same thing as a stored truth — both are required for sovereign integrity.

### **17.7 Enforcement Properties**
THT Protocol™ enforces five permanent properties:

• **Immutability** — sealed truth cannot be altered.  
• **Irreversibility** — time-anchored truth cannot regress without superior proof.  
• **Visibility** — verification does not require permission.  
• **Attribution** — authorship and authority are traceable.  
• **Audit continuity** — institutional history remains reconstructable across time.

Truth does not exist because someone declares it.  
It exists because THT Protocol™ proves it.

### **17.8 Interaction with QENC™**
QENC™ (Quantum Evidence & Coherence ProofCapsule) is the sovereign proof artefact generated when a truth requires long-horizon custody.

When:
• a finding, doctrine, or safety event crosses a material threshold,  
THT Protocol™ handles its sealing,  
and QENC™ provides the durable, exportable proof capsule.

This is the bridge from internal coherence to external sovereign evidence.

### **17.9 The Human Protection Clause**
THT Protocol™ protects human authority as much as system integrity.

When an Owner, Guardian, Operator, or Auditor acts under HML™:
• the action is sealed,  
• the mandate context is recorded,  
• the outcome becomes attributable.

This ensures:
• credit is assignable,  
• liability is lawful,  
• and denial is structurally impossible.

### **17.10 Canonical Statement**
The THT Protocol™ is the sovereign law of truth handling that transforms information into evidence and evidence into irreversible historical reality.

It is the mechanism through which governed intelligence becomes legally visible, institutionally adoptable, and permanently auditable under the TruthSeal™ stack.
