version: 1.0  
status: Locked  
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
classification: Not for Public Use — committee operational doctrine  

scope: This chapter defines the THT Protocol™ (Truth Handling & Timestamping Protocol™) as the sovereign chain-of-custody law that transforms information into verifiable, immutable, and auditable truth for governed Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and embodied systems under the TruthSeal™ stack. Deeper Ω mechanisms remain classified under Doctorantura.

**17.1 Definition**  
The THT Protocol™ (Truth Handling & Timestamping Protocol™) is the sovereign mechanism that governs how truth is processed, sealed, recorded, and externally anchored under TruthSeal™.

THT™ ensures that claims, actions, discoveries, refusals, overrides, and upgrades become legally reconstructable facts rather than narrative assertions.

If NeuroVest™ governs behaviour,  
THT™ governs truth lifecycle.

**17.2 Why It Exists**  
In governed AI and robotics:

• Claims must be provable.  
• Actions must be reconstructable.  
• Knowledge must be attributable.  
• Fraud must be structurally blocked.

THT™ ensures these outcomes using cryptographic facts rather than reputation, trust, or unverifiable statements.

**17.3 Position in the Sovereign Stack**  
THT™ runs beneath every doctrinal, behavioural, and robotic layer:

• The Autonomous Scientific Agent™ (ASA™) produces knowledge — THT™ seals it.  
• NeuroVest™ records consequence — THT™ timestamps it.  
• The Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™) issues command — THT™ binds identity to outcome.  
• TS-R1™ and TS-R2™ act — THT™ makes physical history auditable.

Where behaviour generates meaning,  
THT™ makes it permanent.

**17.4 Core Mechanism**  
THT™ is a three-stage irreversible truth pipeline:

1. **Hashing** — encodes the substantive state or evidence into a cryptographic fingerprint.  
2. **Timestamping** — records the verified moment of existence.  
3. **Anchoring** — binds the fingerprint to external, non-forgeable systems (for example: Bitcoin-based anchoring or approved sovereign ledgers).

Together, these stages form Proof of Reality within the TruthSeal™ order.

**17.5 Behavioural Rule**  
No claim, discovery, override, refusal, ledger event, or upgrade becomes valid TruthSeal™ truth until it passes through THT™.

This prevents:

• silent removal of errors,  
• convenient rewrite of history,  
• unprovable authorship,  
• unverifiable governance.

**17.6 THT™ and the Evolving Record**  
THT™ is the handling and sealing law.  
The Epoch Verification Ledger™ (EVL™) is where sealed truths accumulate into a reconstructable timeline.

THT™ is the verb.  
EVL™ is the archive.

**17.7 Enforcement Properties**  
The THT Protocol™ enforces:

• **Immutability** — sealed truth cannot be altered.  
• **Irreversibility** — once time-anchored, truth cannot regress.  
• **Visibility** — verification can be performed without permission.  
• **Credibility** — time establishes who knew what and when.

Truth does not exist because someone says so —  
it exists because THT™ proves it.

**17.8 Interaction with QENC™ and ASA™**  
When ASA™ produces insight worthy of preservation, THT™ seals and anchors it, and the Quantum Evidence & Coherence ProofCapsule™ (QENC™) provides the binding artefact for long-term sovereign evidence.

This exports truth from disciplined inquiry into permanent institutional record.

**17.9 The Human Mandate Component**  
THT™ also protects human roles:

• Owner, Guardian, Operator, Auditor, and Regulator actions are sealed.  
• Credit is assignable.  
• Liability is attributable.  
• Denial of action becomes impossible without contradiction of receipts.

This closes the legal custody loop for high-stakes autonomy.

**17.10 Canonical Statement**  
The THT Protocol™ is the sovereign truth-handling law that transforms information into verifiable truth, truth into evidence, and evidence into unbreakable historical reality.

It is the mechanism through which governed AI and robotics become legally visible, institutionally adoptable, and permanently accountable.
