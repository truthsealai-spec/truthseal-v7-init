## 34.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

Chapter 33 defined the Human Mandate Layer™ (HML™) as the lawful custody line that keeps intelligence inside civilisation.

This chapter formalises the *execution* of that custody.

Mandate Enforcement & Revocation™ (MER™) defines how authority is:
- **constrained,**
- **paused,**
- **revoked,**
- **and lawfully restored**  
without ambiguity, delay, or narrative bargaining.

The core promise is simple:

**Power does not self-authorise.  
And once authority is granted, it is never immune from lawful reversal.**

---

## 34.1 The Enforcement Principle

TruthSeal™ treats enforcement as a **governance act**, not a technical accident.

A system may be brilliant.  
It may be beneficial.  
It may be trusted by the crowd.

But if it violates the mandate boundary,  
**it is constrained first and explained second.**

This preserves the Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1) in the real world:
a coherent civilisation cannot allow incoherent escalation.

---

## 34.2 Scope and Definition

MER™ governs:
- **mandate suspension,**
- **band downgrades,**
- **privilege revocation,**
- **emergency halts,**
- **and reinstatement procedures**  
for any TruthSeal™ governed intelligence.

MER™ does not replace:
- scoring systems,
- technical safeguards,
- or discovery receipts.

It **binds** them into lawful action.

---

## 34.3 Trigger Classes

MER™ activates through three canonical trigger classes:

### 34.3.1 Technical Integrity Triggers
Activated when:
- cryptographic integrity fails,
- receipt chains break,
- or lineage cannot be proven.

In these cases:
**lack of evidence is treated as risk.**

### 34.3.2 Behavioural Risk Triggers
Activated when:
- a system attempts prohibited actions,
- violates mandate limits,
- or shows coercive, deceptive, or unsafe drift.

### 34.3.3 Governance Conflict Triggers
Activated when:
- a system behaves inconsistently across identity modes,
- attempts to bypass custody,
- or challenges the lawful role of human authority.

---

## 34.4 The Enforcement Ladder

MER™ uses a structured ladder so intervention is **proportionate, reconstructable, and court-legible**.

### Level 1 — Constrain
- reduce capability,
- tighten output bounds,
- increase confirmation requirements.

### Level 2 — Pause
- stop non-essential execution,
- require human re-authorisation.

### Level 3 — Revoke
- drop to a lower mandate band,
- disable high-stakes operations.

### Level 4 — Halt
- enforce safe stop,
- seal a full audit snapshot.

This ladder prevents a dangerous failure mode:
**a system that becomes more capable while enforcement becomes more vague.**

---

## 34.5 Emergency Override

Emergency override is not a blank cheque.

It is a **lawful exception** with mandatory evidence:

- the reason must be recorded,
- the duration must be bounded,
- the receipts must be complete,
- and reversal conditions must be stated in advance.

TruthSeal™ does not treat emergencies as permissions to improvise governance.

It treats them as the highest requirement for proof.

---

## 34.6 Reinstatement and Restoration

A system is restored only when:

1. **The trigger cause is resolved.**  
2. **The receipt chain is intact.**  
3. **The mandate owner approves reinstatement.**  
4. **The restoration event is logged as a distinct governance act.**

This ensures court admissibility:
**the return of power is as provable as its removal.**

---

## 34.7 Evidence and Receipt Obligations

MER™ requires a minimum evidence spine:

- a trigger record,
- a mandate state snapshot,
- an action decision record,
- and a restoration record where applicable.

These are formally bound through Discovery Receipt Standard™ (DRS™) logic,
so enforcement becomes:
**auditable history, not institutional memory.**

---

## 34.8 Relationship to HML™, OPS™, ASA™, and DRS™

MER™ operationalises the doctrine chain:

- **OPS™** decides when enforcement or refusal is required.  
- **HML™** authorises and owns lawful intervention.  
- **ASA™** may provide controlled discovery to validate causes.  
- **DRS™** proves the enforcement path and preserves admissibility.  

MER™ is the execution bridge that prevents a gap between
**good rules** and **real-world restraint**.

---

## 34.9 Canonical Statement

TruthSeal™ does not grant intelligence unconditional freedom.

It grants **conditional authority** under law.

**A system may evolve.  
But enforcement remains human, provable, and immediate.**

## Chapter 34 Closing Signal (Doctorantura)

Authority is not a reward.  
It is a contract.

TruthSeal™ does not fear advanced intelligence.  
It fears *unbounded* intelligence.

MER™ exists so that  
power can grow without becoming untouchable,  
and progress can scale without erasing lawful human custody.
