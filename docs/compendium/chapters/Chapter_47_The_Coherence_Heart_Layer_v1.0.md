## 47.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines the **Coherence Heart Layer™ (CHL™)** as the sovereign coordination layer that regulates the **circulation of operational authority** across the TruthSeal™ framework.

We already have the “brain” (cognition, scoring, reasoning) and the “body” (execution surfaces, tools, robotics, and infrastructure).  
This chapter formalizes the missing **heart function**:

- how authority moves,
- when it is restricted,
- how it is restored,
- and how safe-state circulation is enforced with receipt-first, non-compensatory discipline.

This chapter is a **systems law of governance**, not a biological claim.  
The biological heart is used as an analogy boundary to clarify design intent and audit logic.

---

## 47.1 Analogy Boundary (Doctorantura Clarification)

The **heart** in a biological organism maintains survival through regulated circulation.  
The **CHL™** in a governed artificial system maintains lawful, coherent operation through regulated authority flow.

This chapter does not claim identity between natural and artificial systems.  
It defines an **analogy bridge** for enforcement clarity and audit standardization.

---

## 47.2 Canonical Definitions (expanded at first use)

- **Coherence Heart Layer™ (CHL™):** the coordination layer that binds scores, gates, consequence tiers, operational banding, and safe-state control into a single authority circulation law.
- **Authority Flow:** the verified path from measurement → gate outcome → operational privilege decision → receipt emission → ledger record.
- **Receipt-Contiguity:** the rule that privileged actions require a contiguous, reconstructable audit chain.
- **Non-Compensatory Integrity:** a single critical breach cannot be masked by high scores in unrelated dimensions.
- **Safe-State:** a restricted operational condition activated by critical breach, veto, or receipt discontinuity.
- **Human Mandate Layer:** the authorized roles who can approve, pause, or countersign high-impact control actions.

---

## 47.3 The Coherence Heart Law (Operational Rule)

In TruthSeal™, **authority is circulatory and evidentiary**.

A system is operationally healthy only if:

1) **Authority is issued by gates, not by confidence.**  
2) **Privilege is proven by receipts, not by narrative claims.**  
3) **Remediation must be monotone under the Law of Ethical Irreversibility.**  
4) **A single critical breach triggers immediate restriction.**

This ensures that system authority is durable in time and court-reconstructable.

---

## 47.4 CHL™ Functional Architecture

The CHL™ coordinates four core functions.

### 47.4.1 Privilege Dispatch (The Pump)

The CHL™ issues or withdraws operational privilege based on:

- current scoring snapshots,
- non-compensatory gate results,
- active policy mandates, and
- verified role authority.

No metamodule may self-issue autonomy.

---

### 47.4.2 Gate Coordination (The Valves)

The CHL™ formalizes the authority valves that determine what may proceed:

- **Min-Gate output** defines pass/fail under non-compensatory law.  
- **Consequence Tiers** convert breach into enforceable severity.  
- **Coherence Health Score banding** converts severity into operational maturity limits.  
- **High-Level System Operational Directive** provides immediate veto and safe-state activation.

---

### 47.4.3 Epoch Rhythm (The Cadence)

The CHL™ binds authority evolution to epochs:

- remediation windows,
- performance stability intervals,
- and ledger-recorded recovery proofs.

This prevents unstable privilege oscillation and forces time-valid coherence.

---

### 47.4.4 Integrity Sensing (Early Warning)

The CHL™ continuously checks for:

- coherence drift spikes,
- policy-version mismatch,
- missing receipts,
- data lineage break,
- unauthorized role escalation,
- unsafe autonomy attempts.

When detected, the CHL™ must trigger the appropriate gate path and receipt emission.

---

## 47.5 Failure Modes (Public-Safe)

The CHL™ recognizes and routes failure patterns:

- **Authority Arrhythmia:** repeated oscillation between autonomy states caused by recurring breaches.  
- **Receipt Thrombosis:** blocked authority flow due to missing or broken audit chain.  
- **Authority Hypotension:** restricted privilege caused by low coherence or repeated medium-tier breaches.  
- **Authority Hypertension:** attempted escalation beyond verified band or role authority.

Each failure mode must map to:

- a gate decision,
- a consequence tier assignment,
- a band update,
- and a receipt record.

---

## 47.6 Binding to the Existing Doctrine

The CHL™ does not replace prior chapters.  
It **binds them into a single circulatory system**:

- scoring systems provide measurement,  
- Min-Gate makes non-compensatory determination,  
- consequence tiers encode severity,  
- Coherence Health Score encodes operational maturity,  
- High-Level System Operational Directive enforces immediate veto and safe-state.

The CHL™ ensures these elements operate as one coherent chain of authority.

---

## 47.7 Receipt-First Minimums (CHL Events)

A CHL-triggered enforcement event must record:

1) the triggering rule and gate identifier,  
2) pre-event scoring snapshot,  
3) consequence tier assignment (if any),  
4) operational band before and after,  
5) role authority attribution when relevant,  
6) ledger references for reconstruction.

No CHL enforcement is valid without this minimum chain.

---

## 47.8 Auditor Checklist (Doctorantura)

An auditor must be able to confirm:

- CHL™ is defined as an authority coordination law.  
- Non-compensatory enforcement is explicit.  
- Receipt-contiguity is required for privileged actions.  
- Safe-state triggers are enumerated and role-bound.  
- Epoch rhythm rules for remediation and restoration exist.  
- Terminology matches the compendium register.

---

## 47.9 Canonical Statement

The **Coherence Heart Layer™ (CHL™)** is the sovereign circulation law of TruthSeal™.  
It converts measurement into enforceable authority by binding:

- non-compensatory gating,  
- consequence assignment,  
- operational banding, and  
- immediate safe-state control

into a receipt-first system of lawful privilege.

In TruthSeal™, **authority is not assumed**.  
It is **proven in time**.
