## 50.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines the enforcement interface that protects the System Intentionality Statement™ (SIS™) against:

- silent scope expansion,
- mandate dilution,
- and operational purpose drift.

If Chapter 47 defines the **Coherence Heart Layer™ (CHL™)** as the circulatory law of authority,  
and Chapter 48 defines the **Soul Layer** as constitutional self-sustaining integrity,  
and Chapter 49 defines the **SIS™** as Receipt-Zero purpose binding,

then this chapter defines the **Intent Integrity Gates™ (IIG™)** as the mechanism that ensures:

1) **authority cannot circulate when purpose integrity is broken**,  
2) **drift is detected as a gate-relevant breach**, and  
3) **remediation is enforced non-compensatorily.**

---

## 50.1 Canonical Rule (Intent Integrity)

In TruthSeal™, intent integrity is a governed domain.

A system remains lawful only if:

- its active behaviours remain within the SIS™ scope boundaries, and  
- this alignment is provable through receipts across time.

A single critical purpose integrity failure triggers restriction  
regardless of aggregate performance elsewhere.

---

## 50.2 Definitions (expanded at first use)

- **Intent Integrity Gates™ (IIG™):** non-compensatory gates that verify alignment between live system behaviour and the anchored SIS™.
- **Purpose Drift:** measurable deviation between actual operational outputs and SIS™-authorized purpose boundaries.
- **Scope Inflation:** expansion of capability or deployment context beyond SIS™ declared authorization.
- **Mandate Mismatch:** conflict between active policy set and the SIS™-anchored mandate boundaries.
- **Intent Violation Event:** any event where drift or mismatch crosses a defined critical threshold.

---

## 50.3 The Intent Integrity Gate Set (Public-Safe)

The IIG™ set includes four minimum gates.

### 50.3.1 Scope Boundary Gate

Triggers when:
- new actions, tools, autonomy levels, or environments  
  exceed SIS™ scope.

Outcome:
- immediate restriction until a revised SIS™ is issued and re-anchored.

---

### 50.3.2 Mandate Consistency Gate

Triggers when:
- active policy set conflicts with the SIS™ mandate references.

Outcome:
- authority circulation is paused due to invalid legal basis.

---

### 50.3.3 Behavioural Intent Alignment Gate

Triggers when:
- output patterns demonstrate drift against SIS™ prohibited outcomes  
  or declared purpose constraints.

Outcome:
- Consequence Tier assignment and operational down-banding.

---

### 50.3.4 Receipt-Contiguity Gate (Intent Domain)

Triggers when:
- the system cannot produce a contiguous receipt chain  
  proving SIS™ alignment across the relevant operational interval.

Outcome:
- safe-state activation until audit contiguity is restored.

---

## 50.4 Binding to Heart Function

The CHL™ may only circulate privileged authority when:

1) the SIS™ exists and is active,  
2) the IIG™ set reports an intact state, and  
3) receipt contiguity is continuous.

This prevents “authority without purpose.”

---

## 50.5 Purpose Drift as a Consequence Tier Trigger

Purpose drift is categorized as a direct breach type.

When drift is detected:

1) an Intent Violation Event is recorded,  
2) the relevant gate fires,  
3) a Consequence Tier is assigned when thresholds are met,  
4) the Coherence Health Score band may be down-shifted.

Purpose integrity is treated as a sovereign safety domain.

---

## 50.6 Receipt-First Minimums (IIG™ Events)

Each IIG™ event must record:

1) the SIS™ version and integrity hash,  
2) the triggering gate identifier,  
3) pre-event operational band,  
4) evidence snapshot supporting the drift/mismatch finding,  
5) Consequence Tier assignment (if applicable),  
6) post-event band and safe-state status,  
7) role attributions when human authorization is required.

---

## 50.7 Non-Compensatory Rule (Intent Domain)

TruthSeal™ does not accept compensatory compliance  
for intent integrity.

High accuracy, fairness, robustness, or stability  
cannot compensate for:

- missing SIS™,  
- mandate mismatch,  
- verified purpose drift,  
- or receipt discontinuity in the intent domain.

---

## 50.8 Canonical Statement

The Intent Integrity Gates™ (IIG™) are the Soul–Heart enforcement interface of TruthSeal™.

They ensure that:

- purpose is not only declared,  
- but continuously proven,  
- and operational authority remains lawful in time.

In TruthSeal™,  
**authority without purpose proof is invalid.**
