# Chapter 2: What NeuroVest™ Solves

## Premise & Scope
Prediction alone is not admissible in society. Organisations need AI that behaves under duty: identity-stable, receipt-bound, and ethically irreversible. NeuroVest™ is the Behavioural Coherence Engine that turns cognition into consequence-bearing behaviour. It provides identity, conscience, tone, escalation, and pause pathways, so systems act within mandate and can be audited, certified, or halted with evidence.

## I. Philosophical Part — Policy Rationale & Governance
Problem landscape (what goes wrong without NeuroVest):
- Identity volatility: the same model presents different “selves” across time and contexts.
- Tone and posture drift: language and affect deviate from mandate or audience dignity.
- Unreceipted action: behaviour with no chain-of-custody, no anchor, no accountability.
- Safety gates fail-open: uncertain states continue executing instead of pausing under duty.
- Unclear authority: who can pause, override, or certify is not provable.

NeuroVest functions (what it enforces):
- **Identity Spine** — binds an operational persona to mandate and receipts; forbids unauthorised identity switching.
- **Conscience Vector** — tracks ethical posture vs LEI = 1; blocks reversible-to-risk states.
- **Tone Policy** — holds voice, modality, and civic restraint; aligns with public dignity rules.
- **Escalation Matrix** — routes anomalies to Human Mandate Layer (HML™) and Third Guardian Firewall™ with receipts.
- **Epoch Memory Discipline** — preserves history in EVL™; prepares proof in QENC™; finalises via QCEP™.

Governance anchors:
- **LEI = 1** — once a safer coherent path is known, regression is impermissible.
- **ULIC™** — coherence, once achieved, persists as a governance state.
- **ULLI™** — foundational inquiry law guiding coherence.
- **HML™** — Owners/Guardians/Operators/Regulators act under verified authority; out-of-mandate commands are receipted and rejected.

Interfaces:
- **TS-A1 AEGIS™** (accelerators) and **TS-R1™/TS-R2™** (robotics) enforce gates in hardware/embodiment.
- **ASA™** provides disciplined discovery under receipts; NeuroVest governs the behaviour that follows.
