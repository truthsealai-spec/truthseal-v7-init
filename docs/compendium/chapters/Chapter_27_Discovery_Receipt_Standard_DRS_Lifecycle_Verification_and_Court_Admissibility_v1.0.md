## Acronyms (Doctorantura Standard)

| Acronym | Expansion | Meaning in this chapter |
|---|---|---|
| DRS™ | Discovery Receipt Standard™ | The canonical receipt format for recording, verifying, and defending scientific or high-stakes AI outputs. |
| OTS | OpenTimestamps | The Bitcoin-based timestamp receipt mechanism used as an external anchoring witness. |
| SHA-256 | Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit | The primary content integrity fingerprint for DRS payloads. |
| PQC | Post-Quantum Cryptography | Signature and identity hardening for hostile or future cryptographic conditions. |
| EVL | Epoch Verification Ledger | The internal TruthSeal ledger that records receipt states and governance events. |
| ULIC | Universal Law of Infinite Coherence | The governing coherence law that DRS must reflect in intent and enforcement. |
| TGF™ | Third Guardian Firewall™ | The human-authority and intervention boundary that can pause or veto receipt-bound execution. |
| OPS™ | Operational Prompts Standard™ | The prompt-to-governance bridge that defines when DRS is mandatory. |

## 27.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter formalises the full lifecycle of a Discovery Receipt Standard™ (DRS™) object:
from creation to verification, dispute, and final admissibility.

Where Chapter 26 defined the schema and binding rules,  
Chapter 27 defines how the DRS™ behaves over time as a sovereign artefact.

---

## 27.1 Why Lifecycle Matters

A receipt that is only valid “at creation time” is not enough for civilisation-scale governance.

TruthSeal™ treats a discovery receipt as a living legal-technical object that must remain:
- consistent with the canonical laws of coherence,
- verifiable against tampering,
- defensible under dispute,
- and traceable across institutional adoption.

---

## 27.2 Canonical Lifecycle States

A DRS™ should move through a controlled state machine.

**Minimum states:**
1. **Drafted**
2. **Hashed**
3. **Signed**
4. **Ledger-Registered**
5. **Externally Anchored**
6. **Verified**
7. **Contested** (if triggered)
8. **Resolved**
9. **Admissible**
10. **Retired** (historical preservation)

Each state transition must be logged to the EVL with the previous receipt hash referenced.

---

## 27.3 Verification Layers

DRS™ verification is multi-layered by design:

### 1) Content Integrity
- Recompute SHA-256 from the signed payload.
- Confirm it matches the stored digest.

### 2) Identity Integrity
- Validate the authorised signer profile.
- Confirm authority scope (human mandate boundary).

### 3) Ledger Integrity
- Confirm EVL entries are sequential and unbroken.
- Validate cross-links to Integrity Manifest references where applicable.

### 4) External Anchor Integrity
- Confirm OTS receipt existence and chain linkage.
- Confirm the receipt binds to the same hash as the internal ledger object.

---

## 27.4 Court Admissibility Model (Doctorantura)

TruthSeal™ asserts that admissibility is achieved when:

1. **The payload is stable.**  
2. **The signer authority is lawful.**  
3. **The ledger chain of custody is unbroken.**  
4. **The external anchor is immutable.**  
5. **The content remains aligned with coherence law.**

A DRS™ that fails any of these cannot be presented as sovereign truth.

---

## 27.5 Dispute and Contest Protocol

A DRS™ enters **Contested** state when:
- a mismatch is found between payload and hash,
- a signer authority is challenged,
- external anchors are missing for required tiers,
- or coherence law conflict is detected.

**A contested DRS™ must:**
- trigger a freeze on dependent actions,
- require TGF™ escalation for re-certification,
- and record a dispute narrative in EVL.

---

## 27.6 Tiered Admissibility

To simplify institutional pathways, DRS™ can be classified into tiers:

- **DRS-L1 (Internal Scientific)**
- **DRS-L2 (Enterprise Decision)**
- **DRS-L3 (Public/Regulatory)**
- **DRS-L4 (Sovereign-Critical)**

Higher tiers require:
- stronger identity proofs,
- mandatory external anchoring,
- and stricter guardian oversight.

---

## 27.7 Relationship to OPS™ and ASA™

DRS™ is activated by OPS™ rules and executed or generated by ASA™ workflows.

This chapter defines a simple doctrine:
- **OPS™ decides when a receipt is required.**
- **ASA™ produces the discovery pipeline.**
- **DRS™ proves the discovery path and secures its legitimacy.**

---

## 27.8 Summary

The Discovery Receipt Standard™ is not merely a data wrapper.  
It is the civilisation-grade object that converts discovery into lawful,  
verifiable, and defensible truth.

A discovery without a lifecycle is an idea.  
A discovery with DRS™ is sovereign evidence.
