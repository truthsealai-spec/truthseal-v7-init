# Chapter 27 — Discovery Receipt Standard™ (DRS™): Lifecycle, Verification, and Court Admissibility
version: 1.0
status: Draft — Doctorantura Edition
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.), Founder and Chief Architect of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign AGI Framework
date_utc: 2025-12-10

## 27.0 Purpose (Public-Operational)

This chapter defines the **Discovery Receipt Standard™ (DRS™)** as the canonical doctrine that converts governed discovery into **provable, reconstructable, court-admissible evidence** within the TruthSeal™ ecosystem.

DRS™ ensures that:

- discovery events are not asserted by narrative,
- legitimacy is not granted by reputation,
- and scientific or technical claims are not accepted without auditable chain-of-evidence.

DRS™ is the TruthSeal™ mechanism that transforms **“a discovery happened”** into **“a discovery is proven in time.”**

---

## 27.1 Scope (Doctorantura)

This standard applies to any TruthSeal™ governed system that:

1) generates new knowledge, designs, or technical conclusions,  
2) uses automated or semi-automated research agents, and/or  
3) intends to publish, certify, defend, or commercialize discoveries under sovereign integrity rules.

This chapter defines public-safe doctrine and does not disclose classified internal implementations.

---

## 27.2 Core Principle (Receipt-First Discovery)

In TruthSeal™, discovery legitimacy is proven only when:

- the discovery path is captured in structured evidence,  
- the evidence is bound into a receipt lifecycle, and  
- the receipt chain is reconstructable without trust in the author.

A discovery without a valid DRS™ chain is **non-legitimate** for sovereign or institutional purposes.

---

## 27.3 Canonical Definitions (expanded at first use)

- **Discovery Receipt Standard™ (DRS™):** the receipt doctrine for proving that a discovery was reached through lawful, traceable, reproducible, and non-compensatory integrity conditions.
- **Discovery Event:** a bounded claim of new knowledge, mechanism, method, system design, or validated result.
- **Receipt Lifecycle:** the ordered chain from intent → execution → evidence → verification → admissibility.
- **Court Admissibility (TruthSeal sense):** the ability for an independent evaluator to reconstruct the discovery path from receipts without reliance on informal narrative or personal authority.
- **Non-Compensatory Proof:** a single critical evidence breach cannot be offset by unrelated strengths in other areas.

---

## Acronyms (Doctorantura Standard)

- **DRS™ — Discovery Receipt Standard™:** the canonical receipt framework that proves discovery lifecycle integrity and court-admissible legitimacy.  
- **OPS™ — Operational Prompts Standard™:** the rule layer that defines when discovery receipts are mandatory and what minimum evidence must be captured.  
- **ASA™ — Autonomous Scientific Agent™:** the governed discovery engine that executes experiments or research workflows and generates structured evidence for DRS™ binding.  

---

## 27.4 The DRS™ Lifecycle

DRS™ defines a five-stage lifecycle.

### 27.4.1 Stage 1 — Mandated Intent Declaration

Before discovery execution begins, the governed system must record:

- the discovery aim,
- the permissible methods,
- constraints and risk boundaries,
- and authorized roles.

This ensures that retrospective narrative cannot rewrite the intended path.

---

### 27.4.2 Stage 2 — Governed Execution and Evidence Capture

During discovery activity, the system must capture structured evidence that includes:

- data inputs and provenance,  
- experimental or computational steps,  
- intermediate outputs,  
- failure attempts (when relevant),  
- and role-authorized intervention points.

Evidence must be timestamp-able and bound to identity and policy scope.

---

### 27.4.3 Stage 3 — Integrity Binding and Hash Anchoring

A valid DRS™ chain requires:

- integrity hashes for the evidence bundle,  
- versioned policy alignment,  
- and recorded linkage to the governing framework.

This prevents silent edits to discovery history.

---

### 27.4.4 Stage 4 — Verification and Reconstructability

Verification is satisfied when an independent auditor can confirm:

- the path is coherent,  
- the evidence is contiguous,  
- the methods match approved scope,  
- and the result follows from the recorded chain.

---

### 27.4.5 Stage 5 — Admissibility and Institutional Readiness

A discovery becomes institution-ready when:

- receipt evidence meets minimum completeness,  
- violations (if any) are recorded with consequences,  
- and the result’s legitimacy tier is assigned under non-compensatory rules.

---

## 27.5 DRS™ Minimum Receipt Bundle

For any discovery event, the minimum DRS™ receipt chain must include:

1) **Intent and mandate record** (scope of allowed discovery).  
2) **Role authority attribution** (Owner / Guardian / Operator or equivalent).  
3) **Evidence lineage** (inputs, sources, permissions).  
4) **Method trace** (steps, tools, configurations).  
5) **Intermediate outputs** sufficient for reconstruction.  
6) **Integrity hashes** for the evidence bundle.  
7) **Outcome statement** linked to the chain.  
8) **Consequence annotations** if breaches or anomalies occurred.

---

## 27.6 Non-Compensatory Validity Rule

TruthSeal™ does not accept compensatory discovery legitimacy.

A discovery is invalid for sovereign or court-grade usage if:

- evidence is missing,  
- provenance is broken,  
- role authority is unverified, or  
- integrity hashes cannot be reproduced.

High-quality results cannot override broken receipts.

---

## 27.7 Relationship to OPS™ and ASA™

DRS™ is activated by OPS™ rules and executed or generated by ASA™ workflows.

This chapter defines a simple doctrine:

- **OPS™ decides when a receipt is required.**  
- **ASA™ produces the discovery pipeline.**  
- **DRS™ proves the discovery path and secures its legitimacy.**

In practice, this means:

1) OPS™ issues the mandatory trigger conditions for DRS™.  
2) ASA™ performs the governed discovery actions under those triggers.  
3) DRS™ binds the evidence into a lifecycle that survives external scrutiny.

---

## 27.8 Failure Modes (Public-Safe)

DRS™ recognizes the following non-exhaustive failure patterns:

- **Receipt Discontinuity:** missing evidence steps break the chain.  
- **Scope Drift:** methods exceed approved intent boundaries.  
- **Role Contamination:** unauthorized intervention alters discovery lineage.  
- **Integrity Mismatch:** hashes cannot be reproduced from the evidence.  
- **Narrative Override Attempt:** attempts to substitute explanation for receipts.

Each failure mode must map to:

- a restriction outcome,  
- a consequence tier reference (where applicable),  
- and an auditor-visible receipt flag.

---

## 27.9 Auditor Checklist (Doctorantura)

An auditor must be able to confirm:

- DRS™ lifecycle stages are explicitly defined.  
- The minimum receipt bundle is present.  
- Non-compensatory legitimacy is enforced.  
- OPS™ and ASA™ integration doctrine is explicit.  
- Evidence, intent, and role attribution form a contiguous chain.  
- The chapter matches compendium naming and acronym standards.

---

## 27.10 Canonical Statement

The **Discovery Receipt Standard™ (DRS™)** is TruthSeal’s court-ready doctrine for discovery legitimacy.

In TruthSeal™, discovery is not a claim.  
It is a **receipt-bound, lifecycle-verified event**.
