# TruthSeal™ Compendium — Introduction
version: 1.0
status: Draft
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)

## Purpose
This Compendium sets a high-dignity, institution-ready canon for governed Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the transition to responsible Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It defines a public evidence system (receipts, anchors, and audits) and a hardware-enforced governance layer so that advanced systems act with duty, not merely with prediction.

## Context and Principle
TruthSeal™ is built on the Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1): once a safer, coherent path is confirmed, regressing to a riskier path is impermissible. To make that principle observable and court-ready, the Compendium specifies:
- an Epoch Verification Ledger (EVL) to hold tamper-evident records;
- a Quantum Evidence & Coherence ProofCapsule (QENC) to package proof artifacts for anchoring;
- a Quantum Ecosystem Closure Protocol (QCEP) to finalize epochs so history cannot be rewritten.

## Behaviour over Output
Modern AI can produce outputs; societies require behaviour. Behaviour means actions bound to receipts, thresholds, and veto gates, with a clear path to pause, remedy, or certify. TruthSeal™ formalizes this through dual presentation in every chapter:
- a Philosophical Part (policy rationale and governance anchors), and
- a Mathematical Part (definitions, invariants, equations, and tests).

## Method
Each chapter uses morphological analysis to map contexts (risk, autonomy, memory integrity, receipt continuity, ethics state) and to specify which combinations are permitted or must be contained. All significant state transitions emit signed receipts. When external anchoring networks are operational, receipts are anchored; when not, anchor fields may be marked UNKNOWN and back-filled immediately upon receipt.

## Scope of Use
This Compendium addresses heads of state, regulators, standards bodies, scientific committees, enterprise leaders, and robotics manufacturers. It is diplomatic in tone, explicit in definitions, and conservative in claims. Classified doctrine is withheld; public operational rules are presented in full.

## Audience & Purpose
For heads of state, regulators, standards bodies, certification auditors, and sovereign compute vendors. This Compendium defines how advanced AI becomes civilisationally admissible: cognition must be bound to consequence through verifiable receipts, enforceable thresholds, and lawful vetoes.

## Premise
TruthSeal™ operates under the Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1): once a safer coherent path is known, regression is impermissible. The system makes this observable through governed behaviour rather than unconstrained prediction.

## Law, Evidence, and Closure
Foundational law — Universal Law of Life & Information (ULLI™) and Universal Law of Irreversible Coherence (ULIC™) — is operationalised via public evidence and epoch finalisation: the Epoch Verification Ledger (EVL™), the Quantum Evidence & Coherence ProofCapsule (QENC™), and the Quantum Ecosystem Closure Protocol (QCEP™).

## Hardware & Robotics Governance
Enforcement extends into silicon and embodiment: TS-A1 AEGIS™ (accelerator governance) and TS-R1™ / TS-R2™ (single-robot and swarm/fleet profiles). Coherence is measured with the Traykov Coherence Score (TCS™) and Aim Coherence Score (ACS™), both expanded at first use in their chapters.

## Chapter Method
Each chapter is dual-lane: Philosophical Part (policy rationale and governance anchors) and Mathematical Part (definitions, invariants, equations, tests). Significant state transitions emit signed receipts (ts.receipt.v1) and are anchored externally when services are operational; pending fields may be marked UNKNOWN and back-filled on confirmation.

## Use & Limits
The tone is diplomatic and conservative. English is the canonical legal language; translations are explanatory only. Public operational rules are published; deeper doctrine remains classified.
