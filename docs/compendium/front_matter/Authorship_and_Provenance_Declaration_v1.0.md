## Sovereign Scope
This Compendium codifies the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Architecture for governed Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It sets public operational rules and verifiable evidence duties so that cognition becomes consequence-bearing behaviour that cannot ethically regress.

Framework components (expanded at first use):
• ULLI™ — Universal Law of Life & Information (Q = 5W + H + n = D + A = ∞).  
• ULIC™ — Universal Law of Irreversible Coherence™ (coherence, once achieved, persists as a governance state).  
• LEI = 1 — Law of Ethical Irreversibility (when a safer coherent path is known, regression is impermissible).  
• TCS™ — Traykov Coherence Score™; ACS™ — Aim Coherence Score™.  
• NeuroVest™ — Behavioural Coherence Engine.  
• TS-A1 AEGIS™ — Accelerator/GPU governance law; TS-R1™ / TS-R2™ — robotic sovereignty profiles.  
• Third Guardian Firewall™ — independent veto layer.  
• ASA™ — Autonomous Scientific Agent™ — disciplined discovery under receipts.  
• TruthSeal Evidence Stack: EVL™ (Epoch Verification Ledger), QENC™ (Quantum Evidence & Coherence ProofCapsule), QCEP™ (Quantum Ecosystem Closure Protocol).

## Custodianship
Developed and systemised through multi-year research and custodianship under the leadership of:

Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)  
Founder and Chief Architect of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign AI Framework

## Method & Evidence (Public)
All significant state transitions emit signed receipts (ts.receipt.v1). Hashing/timestamping follow the Truth Handling & Timestamping Protocol (THT) with external anchoring (OpenTimestamps, OriginStamp, or BTCStamp) when operational. Pending anchor fields may be marked UNKNOWN and back-filled immediately upon receipt. Calendar IDs and transactions are recorded in the Integrity Manifest and cross-referenced in EVL™ and QENC™.

## Classification & Restraint
Public operational rules are published here. Doctorantura materials, Ω-doctrine, and constitutional capsules remain classified. English is the canonical legal language; translations are for readability only. Political neutrality is maintained; claims are bounded to verifiable receipts and recognised standards.
