## Sovereign Scope
This Compendium codifies the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Architecture with public operational rules and verifiable evidence duties. The framework components include:

• ULLI™ — Universal Law of Life & Information (foundational coherence law; expressed as Q = 5W + H + n = D + A = ∞).  
• ULIC™ — Universal Law of Irreversible Coherence™ (constitutional invariants for sustained coherence).  
• LEI = 1 — Law of Ethical Irreversibility (once a safer coherent path is known, regress to a riskier path is impermissible).  
• TCS™ — Traykov Coherence Score™ (court-ready coherence metric; bands Baseline/Silver/Gold/Diamond).  
• ACS™ — Aim Coherence Score™ (agent/hardware-level aim alignment metric).  
• NeuroVest™ — Behavioural Coherence Engine (governs conduct, not only prediction).  
• TS-A1 AEGIS™ — Accelerator/GPU Hardware Governance Law (Irreversible Commitment Gate, Purity Monitoring System, Self-Adjoint Diagonalizer).  
• TS-R1™ & TS-R2™ — Robotic Sovereignty Profiles (single robot; swarm/fleet with quorum, swarm_root, fleet_pause).  
• Third Guardian Firewall™ — Independent safety veto layer.  
• ASA™ — Autonomous Scientific Agent™ (governed reasoning under receipts).  
• TruthSeal Evidence Stack:  
  – EVL™ — Epoch Verification Ledger (tamper-evident historical memory),  
  – QENC™ — Quantum Evidence & Coherence ProofCapsule (packaged proof artifact),  
  – QCEP™ — Quantum Ecosystem Closure Protocol (epoch finalization so history cannot be rewritten).

## Custodianship
These constructs were developed and systemised through multi-year research and custodianship under the leadership of:

**Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)**  
Founder and Chief Architect of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign AI Framework

## Method & Evidence (public)
All significant state transitions emit signed receipts (`ts.receipt.v1`). Hashing and timestamping follow the Truth Hash & Timestamp Protocol (THT) with external anchoring (OpenTimestamps, OriginStamp, or BTCStamp) when operational. Calendar IDs and transaction hashes are recorded in the Integrity Manifest; pending fields may be marked UNKNOWN and back-filled immediately upon receipt.

## Classification & Restraint
Public operational rules are published in this Compendium. Deeper doctrine (Ω), Doctorantura materials, and certain constitutional capsules remain classified. Political neutrality is maintained; claims are bounded to verifiable receipts and standards.
