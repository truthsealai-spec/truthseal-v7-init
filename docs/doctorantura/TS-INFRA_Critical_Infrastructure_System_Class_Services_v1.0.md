## TS-INFRA — CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM CLASS SERVICES

### 1. SYSTEM CLASS DEFINITION (WHAT IS GOVERNED)

The TS-INFRA System Class governs artificial intelligence, automated control, and decision systems that directly manage, influence, or constrain critical infrastructure operations.

Critical infrastructure systems are defined as systems whose failure, misuse, or manipulation could cause large-scale societal disruption, economic harm, loss of essential services, or cascading national consequences.

These systems may not possess general intelligence, but they operate at structural leverage points within society. Their impact derives from position, dependency, and authority rather than cognitive autonomy.

TS-INFRA applies to systems that control, optimise, schedule, allocate, route, prioritise, or authorise infrastructure functions in live operational environments.

The system class is defined by consequence, not by intent.

---

### 2. INFRASTRUCTURE DOMAINS COVERED

TS-INFRA includes, but is not limited to, systems operating within energy grids, water and waste networks, transportation coordination, aviation control, maritime logistics, telecommunications, satellite ground systems, financial clearing, payment rails, data centre orchestration, and national digital platforms.

Infrastructure systems may be civilian, public-private, or state-operated.

Systems that act as upstream controllers, downstream executors, or decision bottlenecks are included regardless of ownership model.

Support tools, analytics-only platforms, and offline simulations are excluded unless they are directly connected to operational execution pathways.

---

### 3. GOVERNANCE SCOPE (WHAT IS VERIFIED)

TruthSeal™ governs authority boundaries, escalation logic, override conditions, and accountability continuity for infrastructure systems.

Verification ensures that infrastructure actions are authorised, reversible where required, and constrained to declared operational mandates.

Infrastructure systems may not autonomously expand jurisdiction, optimise beyond declared objectives, or prioritise outcomes without explicit governance approval.

All high-impact infrastructure actions are treated as legally consequential decisions.

---

### 4. SAFETY AS SYSTEMIC STABILITY

In TS-INFRA, safety is defined as continuity, resilience, and containment of systemic risk.

TruthSeal™ prevents unsafe outcomes by blocking illegitimate optimisation paths, silent escalation, and uncontrolled automation.

Fail-open behaviour, self-repair without audit trace, and autonomous policy mutation are prohibited.

Safety is enforced structurally through governance gates, not through heuristic confidence.

---

### 5. CLIENT SERVICES DELIVERED

Clients receive continuous governance visibility over infrastructure decision authority and execution pathways.

TruthSeal™ provides proof that infrastructure actions complied with declared mandates at the time of execution.

This enables regulatory confidence, insurance coverage, incident reconstruction, and judicial defensibility.

Services support governments, utilities, financial institutions, infrastructure operators, and national platforms.

---

### 6. CLIENT ELIGIBILITY AND DEPLOYMENT CONTEXT

TS-INFRA services are intended for sovereign entities, regulated operators, system integrators, and institutional infrastructure providers.

Clients must declare infrastructure scope, operational authority, escalation hierarchy, and jurisdictional boundaries.

Any expansion of control surface or functional mandate requires updated governance declaration.

Unauthorised extension voids service coverage.

---

### 7. LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS

TS-INFRA does not certify hardware durability, physical security, or operational excellence.

TruthSeal™ governs authority, accountability, and lawful control — not engineering performance.

Operational responsibility remains with the system operator.

---

### 8. BINDING AUTHORITY

This document constitutes binding doctrine under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

Any infrastructure system operating under the TS-INFRA designation without full compliance is non-conforming by definition.
