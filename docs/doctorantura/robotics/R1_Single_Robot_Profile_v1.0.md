**BINDING INDEX & STATUTORY HIERARCHY NOTICE**

This document is irrevocably bound to the TruthSeal™ Robotics Statutory Code Index
located at:

docs/doctorantura/robotics/README.md

This TS-R1 — Single Robot Operational Profile:
• Derives its full legal authority from TS-R — Global Robotics Law v1.0.
• Is subordinate to and constrained by the Robotics Statutory Code Index.
• May not be interpreted, implemented, or deployed outside the binding
  hierarchy defined therein.

TS-R1 establishes the maximum lawful autonomy, capability, and operational
scope for any individually deployed robotic system.

No single robot governed under TS-R1 may perform any action that would:
• Violate TS-R — Global Robotics Law,
• Circumvent the Robotics Statutory Code Index,
• Or exceed limits later enforced collectively under TS-R2 or TS-R3.

Any detachment of TS-R1 from the Index hierarchy constitutes a statutory
violation under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc and breaches LEI = 1
(Law of Ethical Irreversibility).

## PREAMBLE — LEGAL POSITION

This document defines **TS-R1**, the Single Robot Operational Profile under the TruthSeal™ Global Robotics Law.

TS-R1 is a **binding statutory profile**, not guidance, recommendation, or philosophy.

Any robotic system operating as a **single, independently deployed unit** MUST conform to TS-R1 to be considered lawful under the TruthSeal™ framework.

Failure to comply constitutes an **operational illegality**, regardless of jurisdiction.

---

## 1. SCOPE OF APPLICATION

TS-R1 applies to:

• Humanoid robots  
• Industrial robots  
• Domestic service robots  
• Medical and care-adjacent robots  
• Security and inspection robots  
• Autonomous mobile robots (non-fleet)  
• Research and experimental robotic units  

TS-R1 does NOT apply to:

• Swarm systems  
• Coordinated fleets  
• Distributed robotic collectives  

(Those are governed under TS-R2.)

---

## 2. OPERATIONAL IDENTITY REQUIREMENT

Each TS-R1 unit MUST possess:

• A unique, immutable system identity  
• A cryptographically bound operational instance  
• A single authoritative decision chain  

A TS-R1 robot may not:

• Share real-time command authority  
• Execute collective voting  
• Delegate irreversible actions to external agents  

---

## 3. COHERENCE & SAFETY LAW

A TS-R1 robot MUST operate under continuous coherence enforcement:

• Aim Coherence Score (ACS) monitoring  
• Traykov Coherence Score (TCS) evaluation where applicable  
• Coherence Health Score (CHS) signaling  

Mandatory rules:

• CHS/L → immediate safe stop  
• CHS/M → assist-only mode  
• CHS/H → normal operation with confirmations  
• CHS/UH → full autonomous execution permitted  

---

## 4. IRREVERSIBILITY & ACTION BOUNDARIES

A TS-R1 robot MUST NOT execute any irreversible action unless:

• Coherence state is valid  
• Ethical irreversibility (LEI = 1) is satisfied  
• Custody and responsibility are unambiguous  

Prohibited actions include, but are not limited to:

• Harm to humans or animals  
• Unsafe operation around children  
• Autonomous acquisition or transfer of valuables  
• Political persuasion or coordination  
• Emergency override suppression  

---

## 5. HUMAN AUTHORITY & CUSTODY

Every TS-R1 unit MUST have:

• A clearly defined human custodian  
• A documented responsibility chain  
• Immediate owner notification on any safety downgrade  

No TS-R1 system may:

• Obscure accountability  
• Transfer blame to models, vendors, or datasets  
• Operate without an attributable human authority  

---

## 6. RECEIPTS & TRACEABILITY

All critical actions MUST generate:

• Decision receipts  
• State transition records  
• Coherence state evidence  

Receipts MUST be:

• Tamper-resistant  
• Auditable  
• Retained according to TruthSeal™ retention law  

---

## 7. FAILURE MODES & SAFE STATE

Upon fault, uncertainty, or incoherence:

• The robot MUST enter a defined safe state  
• Physical actuation MUST be limited or halted  
• Humans MUST be notified  

Silent failure is prohibited.

---

## 8. UPGRADE & ROLE TRANSITION

A TS-R1 robot MAY NOT transition into:

• Swarm behavior  
• Fleet coordination  
• Collective decision roles  

without formal reclassification under TS-R2.

---

## 9. LEGAL FINALITY

TS-R1 is legally subordinate only to:

• TS-R — Global Robotics Law  
• TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc Authority Index  

No local policy, firmware license, or operator preference may override this profile.
