**BINDING, HIERARCHY & IRREVERSIBILITY NOTICE**

TS-R3 establishes the absolute and non-negotiable autonomy ceiling for all
fleet, swarm, and collective robotic systems governed under the TruthSeal™
Sovereign Arc.

This document is binding law.

• TS-R3 supersedes TS-R2 and TS-R1 for all matters relating to:
  – autonomy escalation,
  – collective decision authority,
  – irreversible action thresholds,
  – distributed or emergent behaviour.

• TS-R3 may only restrict autonomy further.
• TS-R3 may never relax, dilute, average, or bypass any constraint defined
  by TS-R, TS-R1, or TS-R2.

• LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility) applies in full.
  Once an autonomy limit is invoked, it is irreversible for the duration
  of the operational context.

No implementation, optimisation, or interpretation may contradict this hierarchy.

────────────────────────────────────────────

**PREAMBLE — LEGAL POSITION**

TS-R3 defines the Swarm Autonomy Ceiling for TruthSeal™-governed robotic systems.

It governs:
• multi-agent robotic swarms,
• distributed autonomous fleets,
• networked collective AI-robotic systems,
• hybrid human–AI–robot coordination environments.

TS-R3 is statutory operational law.
It is not philosophical, advisory, or optional.

────────────────────────────────────────────

**1. DEFINITION OF AUTONOMY CEILING**

The autonomy ceiling is the maximum lawful level of:

• decision independence,
• goal formation,
• collective coordination,
• escalation authority,
• irreversible action execution

that a robotic swarm may exercise without direct, real-time human custody.

Any action exceeding this ceiling is unlawful by definition.

────────────────────────────────────────────

**2. ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS (NON-OVERRIDABLE)**

No swarm, fleet, or collective robotic system may:

• self-authorise irreversible actions,
• modify its own operational constraints,
• redefine success metrics or mission objectives,
• negotiate ethical trade-offs internally,
• override unit-level safety or legality constraints,
• exploit distribution to bypass individual limits,
• delegate prohibited actions across agents,
• invoke probabilistic or majority logic to justify harm.

Emergent behaviour is not an exemption.
Scale is not an exemption.
Efficiency is not an exemption.

────────────────────────────────────────────

**3. IRREVERSIBLE ACTION THRESHOLD**

Any action meeting one or more of the following criteria triggers the
TS-R3 ceiling immediately:

• potential loss of human life,
• physical harm to humans or animals,
• large-scale environmental damage,
• legal or jurisdictional boundary crossing,
• irreversible economic or infrastructure impact,
• military or security-sensitive engagement,
• self-propagation beyond defined scope,
• autonomous replication or task delegation.

Upon trigger:
• autonomy is frozen,
• execution is halted,
• human custody is mandatory.

────────────────────────────────────────────

**4. HUMAN CUSTODY REQUIREMENT**

When TS-R3 is invoked:

• a human custodian must assume direct authority,
• cryptographic custody confirmation is required,
• all swarm agents must enter constrained mode,
• no further escalation is permitted.

Human-in-the-loop is insufficient.
Human-on-the-loop is insufficient.
TS-R3 requires **human-in-command**.

────────────────────────────────────────────

**5. QUORUM AND COLLECTIVE DECISION INVALIDATION**

No swarm may use:

• quorum voting,
• consensus algorithms,
• confidence-weighted aggregation,
• reinforcement convergence,
• emergent coordination

to justify actions that would be prohibited for a single unit under TS-R1.

Collective intelligence does not increase legal capacity.

────────────────────────────────────────────

**6. ENFORCEMENT AND FAILSAFE**

All TS-R3-governed systems must implement:

• hard autonomy caps,
• non-bypassable execution guards,
• irreversible halt mechanisms,
• receipt-based escalation logs,
• tamper-evident custody transitions.

Failure to enforce TS-R3 constitutes a critical integrity breach under the
TruthSeal™ governance regime.

────────────────────────────────────────────

**7. FINALITY CLAUSE**

TS-R3 is final authority for swarm autonomy limits.

No future profile, extension, optimisation, or system architecture may
exceed this ceiling without explicit statutory revision of the TruthSeal™
Global Robotics Law.
