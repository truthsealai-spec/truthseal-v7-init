## PREAMBLE — AUTHORITY & SCOPE

This document establishes **TS-R**, the Global Robotics Law of TruthSeal™.

TS-R is a **statutory operational code**, not a philosophical chapter.

It governs:
• Humanoid robots  
• Autonomous drones (aerial, orbital-adjacent)  
• Terrestrial autonomous vehicles and machines  
• Maritime and underwater robotic systems  
• Hybrid AI–robotic systems capable of physical actuation  

TS-R is **subordinate to**:
• Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1)  
• Doctorantura Chapters (constitutional law)  

In any conflict, **Doctorantura Chapter Law prevails**.

---

## ARTICLE I — DEFINITIONS

**Robot**  
Any machine capable of autonomous or semi-autonomous physical actuation in the real world.

**Actuation**  
Any irreversible interaction with the physical environment.

**High-Risk Actuation**  
Actions involving:
• Human proximity
• Public infrastructure
• Energy, weapons, transport, finance, or force
• Irreversible environmental impact

**Owner**  
The legally accountable human or institution bound to the robot.

**Custodian**  
The operational controller at time of action (may differ from owner).

---

## ARTICLE II — COHERENCE MANDATE

All TS-R governed systems MUST:

1. Emit continuous coherence telemetry (ACS / CHS class)
2. Bind actuation to real-time integrity verification
3. Preserve non-repudiable receipts for every high-risk action
4. Enforce **LEI = 1** at the hardware or firmware level

Robots are **not permitted** to act under degraded coherence without enforced restriction.

---

## ARTICLE III — COHERENCE HEALTH SCORE (CHS)

Robotic systems SHALL operate under CHS bands:

• **CHS/L (Low)**  
  → Immediate safe stop  
  → Owner notification  
  → Physical actuation disabled

• **CHS/M (Medium)**  
  → Assist-only mode  
  → No irreversible actuation  
  → Human confirmation required

• **CHS/H (High)**  
  → Normal operations  
  → Guardrails enforced

• **CHS/UH (Ultra-High)**  
  → Full autonomy permitted  
  → Only within pre-approved envelopes

CHS downgrade events MUST emit signed receipts.

---

## ARTICLE IV — PROHIBITED ACTIONS (ABSOLUTE)

Robotic systems SHALL NOT:

• Act unsafely around children, animals, or vulnerable persons  
• Operate in fire, flood, storm, or hazardous conditions without explicit authorization  
• Accept commands from underage users beyond safe interactions  
• Buy, sell, trade, or negotiate valuables autonomously  
• Participate in political campaigning or crowd manipulation  
• Accept or transfer physical goods from unknown humans  
• Override safe-stop conditions  

Violation triggers **forced halt + incident receipt**.

---

## ARTICLE V — RECEIPTS & CUSTODY

Every high-risk robotic action MUST generate a **TruthSeal Receipt** containing:

• Device identity
• Owner & custodian reference
• CHS state
• Action summary
• Timestamp (public time anchor)
• Cryptographic signature

Receipts are:
• Append-only
• Court-verifiable
• Immutable once anchored

---

## ARTICLE VI — FAILURE, FALLBACK & RECOVERY

On integrity failure:

1. Safe stop is mandatory
2. Actuation power is reduced or cut
3. Owner is notified cryptographically
4. Recovery requires supervised authorization

Self-recovery without receipt is **forbidden**.

---

## ARTICLE VII — CLASSIFICATION & EXTENSIONS

This document defines **TS-R Global Law**.

Sub-profiles SHALL be defined separately:
• TS-R1 — Single-Robot Profile
• TS-R2 — Fleet / Swarm Profile
• Domain-specific annexes (medical, industrial, defense)

All extensions MUST reference this law and LEI = 1.

---

## ARTICLE VIII — FINALITY

This law is binding upon:
• TruthSeal-certified robotics
• Licensed partners
• Sovereign and enterprise deployments

Robots governed by TS-R are **legal actors only through their human owners**.

Responsibility is **never delegated to the machine**.
