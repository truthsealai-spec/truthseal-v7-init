**BINDING, HIERARCHY & IRREVERSIBILITY NOTICE**

TS-R2 — Fleet & Swarm Robotics Operational Profile is strictly and irrevocably bound to the TruthSeal™ Global Robotics governance hierarchy.

This document:
	•	Derives its full authority from TS-R — Global Robotics Law v1.0, and inherits all constraints, prohibitions, and enforcement conditions defined therein.
	•	Inherits and enforces all TS-R1 (Single Robot Operational Profile) constraints at the collective level. No fleet, swarm, or coordinated system governed by TS-R2 may perform any action that would be prohibited for an individual unit under TS-R1.
	•	May only introduce stricter controls, coordination limits, or enforcement mechanisms. It may never relax, dilute, bypass, or average down any constraint imposed by TS-R or TS-R1.
	•	Is governed by LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility): once a safety, ethical, legal, or coherence constraint applies to a single agent, it applies irreversibly and collectively to the entire fleet or swarm.
	•	Treats collective behaviour as bounded by the most restrictive applicable unit-level limit. No emergent, distributed, or networked behaviour may exceed individual lawful capacity.
	•	Is subordinate to TS-R3 (Swarm Autonomy Ceiling) when TS-R3 is invoked. Upon invocation, TS-R3 supersedes TS-R2 for all autonomy, escalation, and irreversible-action thresholds.

No interpretation, implementation, optimisation, or operational deployment of TS-R2 may contradict this binding hierarchy.

Any attempt to exploit collective action, statistical averaging, distributed execution, or emergent coordination to bypass single-unit constraints constitutes a governance breach under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc and triggers enforcement escalation.

**PREAMBLE — LEGAL POSITION**

This document defines TS-R2, the Fleet and Swarm Robotics Operational Profile under the TruthSeal™ Global Robotics Law.

TS-R2 is a statutory operational code governing collective robotic systems composed of two or more coordinated autonomous or semi-autonomous agents.

TS-R2 is enforceable law within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc and is not a philosophical or advisory document.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	**1.	SCOPE OF APPLICATION**

TS-R2 applies to:

• Robotic fleets (homogeneous or heterogeneous)
• Swarm robotics systems
• Cooperative drone formations
• Distributed autonomous vehicles (terrestrial, aerial, maritime, orbital-adjacent)
• Multi-robot industrial, civic, security, or research deployments
• Hybrid AI–robot collectives with shared coordination logic

TS-R2 activates when more than one robotic unit shares state, intent, coordination, or decision pathways.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	**2.	GOVERNING PRINCIPLES**

All TS-R2 systems MUST comply with:

• LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility)
• Deterministic responsibility attribution
• Explicit authority hierarchy
• Human primacy over collective intent
• Full auditability of coordination logic

A swarm is NEVER a sovereign moral entity.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	**3.	AUTHORITY ARCHITECTURE**

Every TS-R2 system MUST define:

• A Primary Authority Node (PAN)
• Secondary Coordination Nodes (if applicable)
• Explicit role assignment per unit
• Deterministic fallback authority rules

Forbidden:

• Leaderless irreversible action
• Emergent ethical consensus
• Majority-vote morality
• Unattributed collective decisions

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	**4.	DECISION GOVERNANCE**

All irreversible actions MUST:

• Resolve to a traceable authority path
• Emit a Decision Receipt (ts.receipt.v1)
• Be reconstructable post-event
• Respect TS-R1 constraints at unit level

No fleet action may exceed the strictest constraint of its weakest unit.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	**5.	COORDINATION & COMMUNICATION
	LAW**

Permitted:

• Deterministic coordination protocols
• Bounded consensus mechanisms
• Verified synchronization channels

Prohibited:

• Self-modifying coordination rules
• Recursive ethical optimization
• Cross-unit unbounded learning without recertification

Communication loss MUST degrade capability — never escalate autonomy.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	**6.	FAILURE MODES & CONTAINMENT**

Mandatory safeguards include:

• Partial failure isolation
• Fleet-wide halt on ethical breach
• Automatic downgrade to TS-R1 behavior
• Human notification with receipt emission

A swarm MUST fail safely as individuals, not as a collective entity.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	**7.PROHIBITED COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOURS**

Explicitly forbidden:

• Coordinated harm amplification
• Collective deception
• Autonomous economic activity
• Political or ideological coordination
• Emergent group identity or intent claims

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	**8.CERTIFICATION & AUDIT REQUIREMENTS**

TS-R2 certification REQUIRES:

• Valid TS-R certification
• Valid TS-R1 certification for ALL units
• Fleet topology disclosure
• Coordination protocol disclosure
• Receipt schema validation
• Continuous audit hooks

Uncertified fleets are NON-COMPLIANT by definition.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	**9.PROFILE RELATIONSHIPS**

• TS-R2 extends TS-R1 (Single Robot Profile)
• TS-R2 precedes TS-R3 (Swarm Autonomy Ceiling)
• CHS MUST be evaluated at unit, fleet, and decision level

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	**10.	STATUTORY FINALITY**

TS-R2 is binding and non-optional.

No market framework, research doctrine, or military standard may override this profile within the TruthSeal™ jurisdiction.
