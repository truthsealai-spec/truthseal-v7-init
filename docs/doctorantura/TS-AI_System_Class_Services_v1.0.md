## TS-AI — ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM CLASS SERVICES

### 1. SYSTEM CLASS DEFINITION (WHAT IS GOVERNED)

The TS-AI System Class governs Artificial Intelligence systems that perform bounded, non-general cognitive functions while operating in live, production, or decision-support environments. These systems do not possess general reasoning capability, but they do influence outcomes with legal, financial, operational, or societal consequence.

TS-AI systems include predictive models, classification engines, optimisation systems, recommender systems, scoring engines, control algorithms, and automated decision-support tools. The defining factor is not intelligence depth, but operational impact and dependency by human or institutional actors.

This system class applies exclusively to deployed, continuously operating AI systems. Offline models, experimental research, academic prototypes, and isolated development environments are excluded unless connected to production execution paths.

TS-AI explicitly excludes Artificial General Intelligence systems, autonomous goal-forming agents, and self-directed reasoning entities. Those fall under TS-AGI governance.

TruthSeal™ certifies and governs only explicitly declared AI system instances, with defined scope, authority boundary, and operational context.

---

### 2. GOVERNANCE SCOPE (WHAT IS VERIFIED)

The governance scope for TS-AI focuses on decision integrity, coherence of outputs, authority binding, and traceability of influence. TruthSeal™ evaluates whether system outputs remain consistent with declared purpose, lawful constraints, and operational boundaries.

Governance applies to model inputs, decision outputs, execution triggers, and downstream dependency chains. It does not interfere with internal model architecture or training methodology.

TS-AI governance prevents silent escalation of authority, misuse of probabilistic outputs as deterministic decisions, and uncontrolled automation drift.

If an AI system’s outputs are used to justify or trigger action, governance applies by default.

All governed outputs must remain explainable, attributable, and reviewable.

---

### 3. CLIENT SERVICES DELIVERED

Clients subscribing to TS-AI services receive continuous auditing of AI decision coherence and operational legitimacy. This includes verification that outputs are used only within declared authority limits.

TruthSeal™ provides execution-boundary enforcement, ensuring AI systems cannot independently expand influence beyond approved use cases.

Each governed decision or output generates a verifiable record linking system state, input context, authority reference, and downstream impact.

Clients gain audit-ready documentation suitable for regulators, courts, insurers, and internal governance bodies.

The service enables confident deployment of AI systems in regulated or high-risk environments without relying on informal trust.

---

### 4. SAFETY AS AN EMERGENT PROPERTY

TS-AI does not attempt to predict every failure mode. Instead, safety emerges from strict control over how and where AI outputs may be used.

By enforcing authority limits and preventing illegitimate execution, TruthSeal™ eliminates unsafe escalation pathways before harm occurs.

This model replaces reactive safety mitigation with structural prevention.

Safety is therefore measurable, enforceable, and provable through records, not assumptions.

---

### 5. CLIENT ELIGIBILITY AND USE CONTEXT

TS-AI services are designed for enterprises, financial institutions, insurers, courts, regulators, healthcare operators, infrastructure providers, and public-sector bodies.

Clients must declare the role of each AI system within their organisation, including decision influence level and execution authority.

AI systems may not be repurposed, scaled, or connected to new execution paths without updated governance declaration.

Misuse or misrepresentation voids service coverage.

---

### 6. SERVICE TIERS AND OPERATIONAL DEPTH

TS-AI services are delivered in tiered offerings reflecting decision criticality, jurisdictional exposure, and escalation requirements.

Higher tiers provide stricter coherence thresholds, faster intervention visibility, and deeper audit granularity.

Tiering reflects operational risk, not model sophistication.

All tiers enforce the same foundational laws and authority constraints.

---

### 7. EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS

TS-AI does not certify data quality, training ethics, or model accuracy. It governs operational legitimacy and accountability.

TruthSeal™ does not replace regulatory approval, professional liability, or organisational responsibility.

Clients remain accountable for lawful use within applicable jurisdictions.

---

### 8. BINDING AUTHORITY

This document constitutes binding doctrine under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

Any AI system operating under the TS-AI designation without full compliance is non-conforming by definition.
