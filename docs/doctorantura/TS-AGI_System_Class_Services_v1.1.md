## TS-AGI — ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM CLASS SERVICES

### 1. SYSTEM CLASS DEFINITION (WHAT IS GOVERNED)

The TS-AGI System Class governs Artificial General Intelligence systems that operate as continuously active, multi-domain intelligence engines with autonomous reasoning capacity. These systems are capable of forming abstract goals, reconciling conflicting objectives, and adapting strategies over extended time horizons. They are not task-specific tools, but persistent reasoning entities that influence or determine consequential outcomes.

TS-AGI applies only to deployed systems that are live, operational, and capable of affecting legal, financial, physical, strategic, or societal states. This includes advisory AGI, supervisory AGI, decision-authorising AGI, and execution-adjacent AGI operating within regulated or sovereign environments. The defining characteristic is not intelligence level, but operational authority.

This system class explicitly excludes narrow AI models, offline simulations, research-only agents, benchmarking environments, and sandboxed experimentation. Training systems and evaluation pipelines are not governed under TS-AGI unless they are directly connected to operational execution paths.

TruthSeal™ certifies and governs only its own internally defined AGI service classes. Certification binds to a declared system instance, operational scope, and authority boundary. It does not attach to an organisation in general, nor to a model family abstractly.

Any AGI operating outside this declared scope is considered non-compliant by default.

### 2. GOVERNANCE SCOPE (WHAT IS VERIFIED AND ENFORCED)

The TS-AGI governance scope covers intent formation, planning logic, execution authorisation, and longitudinal system behaviour. Governance is applied before actions occur, not after damage is assessed. No action capable of altering internal or external state may proceed without passing governance enforcement.

TruthSeal™ does not control how the system reasons internally. It governs whether the resulting intent is legitimate, authorised, coherent, and lawful under declared constraints. This distinction preserves cognitive freedom while enforcing execution discipline.

Governance applies continuously. There are no audit intervals, grace periods, or silent operation windows. If a system is active, it is governed. If governance is unavailable, execution must halt or degrade safely.

All authority exercised by the AGI must be traceable to an accountable human or institution. Autonomous authority emergence is explicitly prohibited.

This scope ensures AGI systems remain subordinate to human governance at all times.

### 3. CLIENT SERVICES DELIVERED (WHAT CLIENTS RECEIVE)

Clients subscribing to TS-AGI services receive continuous coherence auditing of their deployed AGI systems. This auditing evaluates alignment between declared purpose, observed behaviour, and lawful execution constraints.

TruthSeal™ enforces pre-execution gating. AGI systems cannot act first and justify later. Every high-impact action must pass legitimacy checks before execution occurs.

Each governed action produces a cryptographically verifiable receipt binding intent, context, authority, and outcome. These receipts are designed for regulatory review, legal proceedings, internal audits, and forensic reconstruction.

Clients also receive escalation visibility, intervention pathways, and enforced containment mechanisms. When coherence degrades or authority boundaries are approached, human supervisors are notified before irreversible action occurs.

The service ensures that AGI behaviour remains explainable, accountable, and governable over time.

### 4. SAFETY AS A STRUCTURAL OUTCOME

TruthSeal™ does not market safety as a standalone feature. Safety emerges as a consequence of enforced coherence, lawful authority binding, and irreversible execution constraints.

By preventing illegitimate actions before they occur, TS-AGI removes reliance on probabilistic safeguards. The system cannot “take a chance” on risky behaviour. If legitimacy is not proven, execution does not proceed.

This approach prevents silent drift, authority creep, and opportunistic risk-taking by intelligent systems. Safety is therefore measurable, enforceable, and auditable.

For governments and enterprises, this means safety is no longer an aspiration. It becomes a structural property of operation.

The absence of safety incidents is not due to luck, but due to blocked illegitimate actions.

### 5. CLIENT ELIGIBILITY AND DEPLOYMENT CONTEXT

TS-AGI services are intended for sovereign bodies, courts, regulators, financial institutions, insurers, critical infrastructure operators, and high-impact enterprises. These clients operate systems where failure carries legal, societal, or systemic consequences.

Clients must declare system purpose, operational scope, authority boundaries, and escalation ownership prior to onboarding. These declarations are binding and enforced.

Each deployment is scoped to a specific AGI instance. Authority may not be duplicated, transferred, or expanded without re-certification.

Use outside declared scope constitutes a governance breach and voids protections.

TruthSeal™ services are not designed for informal, experimental, or consumer use.

---

### 6. SERVICE TIERS AND OPERATIONAL SCALING

TS-AGI services are delivered in tiered offerings aligned with system criticality, jurisdictional exposure, and intervention requirements. Higher tiers impose stricter coherence thresholds and faster escalation guarantees.

Tiering reflects operational impact, not intelligence capability. A modest AGI with sovereign authority may require stricter governance than a more capable advisory system.

All tiers enforce the same core laws, including LEI = 1. No tier weakens foundational constraints.

Scaling increases enforcement depth rather than diluting control.

---

### 7. EXCLUSIONS AND NON-COVERAGE

TS-AGI does not certify training data, model architectures, or benchmark performance. It does not replace regulatory approval or legal responsibility.

TruthSeal™ governs execution legitimacy and accountability, not model quality.

Clients remain responsible for lawful use within their jurisdiction.

Misrepresentation of scope voids service protections.

### 8. BINDING AUTHORITY

This document constitutes binding doctrine under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

Any AGI system operating under the TS-AGI designation without full compliance is non-conforming by definition.
