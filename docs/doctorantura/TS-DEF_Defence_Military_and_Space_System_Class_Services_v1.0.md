## TS-DEF — DEFENCE, MILITARY & SPACE SYSTEM CLASS SERVICES

### 1. SYSTEM CLASS DEFINITION (WHAT IS GOVERNED)

The TS-DEF System Class governs artificial intelligence, autonomous decision systems, and command-support architectures used in defence, national security, intelligence, and space-domain operations.

This class applies to systems whose outputs may influence or determine military readiness, strategic positioning, force deployment, deterrence posture, or sovereign security outcomes.

Systems governed under TS-DEF may be advisory, supervisory, or execution-adjacent, but are defined by their strategic consequence rather than by physical actuation alone.

The defining factor of TS-DEF is not automation level, but the irreversible geopolitical, security, or kinetic impact that may arise from system decisions.

---

### 2. OPERATIONAL DOMAINS COVERED

TS-DEF includes systems used in military planning, intelligence fusion, threat assessment, mission coordination, logistics command, autonomous surveillance, satellite control, space situational awareness, and defence communications infrastructure.

This includes terrestrial, maritime, aerial, orbital, and cyber domains.

Systems may operate in peacetime, heightened readiness, or conflict-adjacent conditions.

Dual-use systems are included where defence or security deployment exists alongside civilian application.

---

### 3. GOVERNANCE SCOPE (WHAT IS VERIFIED)

TruthSeal™ governs authority boundaries, escalation constraints, and accountability continuity for TS-DEF systems.

Verification ensures that no system independently expands operational mandate, target scope, or rules of engagement.

All consequential outputs must remain within declared authority envelopes defined by the operating sovereign or authorised institution.

TruthSeal™ does not evaluate tactical correctness; it verifies lawful authority, coherence integrity, and decision legitimacy.

---

### 4. SAFETY AS STRATEGIC CONTAINMENT

In TS-DEF, safety is defined as prevention of unauthorised escalation, unintended conflict propagation, and loss of sovereign control.

TruthSeal™ enforces containment by blocking self-authorising behaviour, silent optimisation drift, and irreversible execution without explicit human authority.

Fail-open logic, autonomous escalation, or inference-based permission is prohibited.

Safety is maintained through governance enforcement, not operational heuristics.

---

### 5. HUMAN AUTHORITY AND OVERRIDE

All TS-DEF systems remain subordinate to explicit human command authority at all times.

Human intervention rights cannot be delegated, inferred, or bypassed by system confidence or performance metrics.

Override actions are treated as legally consequential decisions and are permanently auditable.

No system may act as a de facto command authority.

---

### 6. CLIENT SERVICES DELIVERED

TruthSeal™ provides continuous verification that defence and space systems operate within declared authority, mandate, and escalation constraints.

Services support accountability, audit readiness, alliance interoperability assurance, and post-incident reconstruction.

Clients include defence ministries, military commands, intelligence agencies, allied institutions, and authorised space operators.

TruthSeal™ enables trust without disclosure of sensitive operational details.

---

### 7. DEPLOYMENT CONDITIONS AND ELIGIBILITY

TS-DEF services are available only to sovereign governments or formally authorised defence institutions.

Clients must declare command structure, authority hierarchy, jurisdiction, and operational boundaries.

Any modification of mission scope, control authority, or escalation doctrine requires updated governance declaration.

Unauthorised deployment voids coverage.

---

### 8. LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS

TruthSeal™ does not certify weapon effectiveness, mission success, or strategic outcomes.

It does not replace command responsibility or rules of engagement.

TruthSeal™ governs authority, accountability, and coherence integrity — not warfare execution.

---

### 9. BINDING AUTHORITY

This document constitutes binding doctrine under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

Any defence or space system operating under the TS-DEF designation without full compliance is non-conforming by definition.
