# TS-Ω (OMEGA MARSHAL PLAN)  
## Master Index — Governed System Class Services

---

## PREAMBLE — PURPOSE OF THIS INDEX

This document constitutes the authoritative master index for all **TruthSeal™ TS-Ω (Omega Marshal Plan)** system class services.  
It defines the **only recognised categories of systems** that TruthSeal™ certifies, governs, licenses, and enforces under its sovereign framework.

This index exists to provide **absolute clarity** to governments, courts, insurers, enterprises, and defence institutions regarding:
- what type of system is being governed,
- what legal and technical guarantees apply,
- what authority boundaries exist,
- and what TruthSeal™ service tier is required.

No system may claim TruthSeal™ protection, certification, or governance unless it is **explicitly mapped to one of the system classes defined herein**.

---

## SCOPE OF GOVERNANCE

TruthSeal™ governs **artificial intelligence, artificial general intelligence, robotic, infrastructure, and defence systems** that operate continuously, autonomously, or semi-autonomously and that may produce **irreversible real-world consequences**.

This governance applies to systems operating:
- 24/7 or continuously,
- across jurisdictions,
- with or without human supervision,
- in digital, physical, or cyber-physical domains.

TruthSeal™ does **not** govern generic software products, consumer applications, or tools without execution authority over reality-affecting actions.

---

## CANONICAL SYSTEM CLASSES (TS-Ω)

TruthSeal™ defines the following **exclusive system classes** under TS-Ω.  
Each class has its own statutory definition, enforcement scope, licensing structure, scarcity profile, and dashboard requirements.

1. **TS-AI — Artificial Intelligence Systems**  
2. **TS-AGI — Artificial General Intelligence Systems**  
3. **TS-R — Robotic Systems (TS-R1, TS-R2, TS-R3)**  
4. **TS-INFRA — Critical Infrastructure Control Systems**  
5. **TS-DEF — Defence, Military, Space, and National Security Systems**

Each system class is governed by its **own dedicated Doctorantura chapter file**, referenced by this index.

---

## SERVICE-BASED GOVERNANCE MODEL

TruthSeal™ system classes are not theoretical categories.  
They are **service-bound governance products** delivered under licensed TruthSeal™ tiers, including but not limited to:

- Base  
- Standard  
- Supreme  
- Ultra  
- Post-Quantum  
- Defence / Space

Each tier defines:
- inclusions,
- exclusions,
- enforcement depth,
- audit cadence,
- dashboard visibility,
- intervention authority,
- and legal guarantees.

Clients purchase governance **by system class and tier**, not by abstract capability.

---

## LICENSING & SCARCITY PRINCIPLE

TruthSeal™ governance services are intentionally scarce.

Scarcity is enforced by:
- system class exclusivity,
- limited certification throughput,
- human oversight constraints,
- and sovereign audit capacity.

Certain system classes (notably TS-AGI, TS-DEF, and TS-R3) are **numerically capped** and subject to enhanced approval thresholds.

This ensures governance integrity, not market saturation.

---

## DASHBOARD & CONTROL PLANE BINDING

Every system governed under TS-Ω is bound to a **TruthSeal™ Governance Dashboard** appropriate to its system class and tier.

Dashboards are:
- human-authoritative,
- receipt-bound,
- non-delegable,
- and legally actionable.

Dashboard requirements differ per system class and are defined in the respective class files.

---

## STATUTORY HIERARCHY

This Master Index is superior to all subordinate TS-Ω system class documents.

No system class document may:
- expand authority beyond this index,
- redefine system scope,
- or dilute enforcement obligations.

Any conflict resolves in favour of this Master Index.

---

## FILE MAP (AUTHORITATIVE)

This index governs the following files:

- TS-AI_System_Service_v1.0.md  
- TS-AGI_System_Service_v1.0.md  
- TS-R_System_Service_v1.0.md  
- TS-INFRA_System_Service_v1.0.md  
- TS-DEF_System_Service_v1.0.md  

---

## FINAL AUTHORITY

This document is binding doctrine under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

Any system misclassified, ambiguously declared, or falsely represented is **non-compliant by definition** and voids all associated protections.
