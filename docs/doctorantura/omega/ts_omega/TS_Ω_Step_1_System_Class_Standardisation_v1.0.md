# TS-Ω STEP 1 — SYSTEM CLASS STANDARDISATION  
**Omega Marshal Plan — Foundational Governance Scaffold (v1.0)**

---

## 1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF SYSTEM CLASS STANDARDISATION

This document defines the **mandatory system class taxonomy** that governs **all TruthSeal™ certifications, licenses, dashboards, receipts, enforcement rules, and commercial offerings**.

TruthSeal™ does **not** certify technology in the abstract.  
TruthSeal™ certifies **explicitly declared system classes**, each with clearly bounded authority, obligations, enforcement mechanisms, and liability structures.

A “system” under TruthSeal™ is **never implicit**.  
It must be **explicitly classified**, **explicitly governed**, and **explicitly licensed**.

This scaffold applies to:
• Artificial Intelligence systems  
• Artificial General Intelligence systems  
• Robotic systems (single, fleet, autonomy-ceiling)  
• Critical infrastructure control systems  
• Defence, military, and space systems  

No TruthSeal™ document, dashboard, receipt, or certification is valid unless it **binds to one or more system classes defined herein**.

---

## 2. GOVERNING PRINCIPLE — CLASS BEFORE CAPABILITY

System class determination precedes **all** other governance actions.

Before any TruthSeal™ interaction occurs, the operator must declare:
• Which system class is being governed  
• The operational domain of that system  
• The highest-risk action the system may perform  
• The jurisdictional and legal context of deployment  

System class determines:
• Which laws apply  
• Which hardware enforcement is mandatory  
• Which dashboard modules are activated  
• Which receipts must be generated  
• Which licensing tier is permitted  
• Which audit depth is required  
• Which commercial model may be offered  

Capabilities may never redefine class.  
Class always constrains capability.

---

## 3. TS-AI — ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS

**System class definition:**  
TS-AI governs **non-general artificial intelligence systems** that operate within a bounded domain and do not exhibit autonomous goal formation.

**Included systems:**  
• Enterprise AI decision engines  
• Financial analytics and pricing systems  
• Legal, medical, or compliance advisory tools  
• Optimisation and forecasting engines  

**Governance obligations:**  
• High-risk decision receipts are mandatory  
• Model version, policy version, and context must be logged  
• Human-authorised override paths must exist  
• Outputs must be traceable and auditable  

**Explicit prohibitions:**  
• Autonomous escalation of authority  
• Cross-domain self-adaptation  
• Self-delegation of governance  

TS-AI systems may never be marketed, certified, or operated as AGI.

---

## 4. TS-AGI — ADVANCED / GENERAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS

**System class definition:**  
TS-AGI governs systems capable of **cross-domain reasoning, long-horizon planning, self-adaptation, or emergent goal behaviour**.

**Included systems:**  
• General reasoning agents  
• Autonomous planners with persistence  
• Multi-objective optimisation systems  
• Research-grade or frontier intelligence systems  

**Mandatory governance requirements:**  
• Continuous Aim Coherence Score (ACS) telemetry  
• Hardware-enforced Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI=1)  
• Active human supremacy controls  
• Irreversible, signed decision receipts  

**Absolute constraints:**  
• No self-modification of governance layer  
• No operation without an active governance dashboard  
• No expansion of authority without human receipt  

TS-AGI systems are **never self-governing**.

---

## 5. TS-R — ROBOTICS SYSTEMS (GLOBAL LAW)

Robotic systems are governed under **TS-R Global Robotics Law** and must be further classified into **mandatory sub-classes**.

Robotics systems always involve **physical actuation** and therefore require stricter governance than software-only systems.

No robotic system may operate without:
• Actuation receipts  
• Human mandate enforcement  
• Safe-stop authority  

---

## 6. TS-R1 — SINGLE-ROBOT SYSTEMS

**System class definition:**  
TS-R1 governs a **single embodied robotic unit** capable of sensing, movement, or physical actuation.

**Governance requirements:**  
• Coherence Health Score (CHS) enforcement  
• Safe-stop and halt authority  
• Human mandate layer  
• Receipts for all irreversible actions  

**Prohibited actions:**  
• Autonomous lethal force  
• Independent procurement or contracting  
• Unreceipted physical intervention  

TS-R1 systems may never self-certify safety.

---

## 7. TS-R2 — FLEET AND SWARM ROBOTICS

**System class definition:**  
TS-R2 governs **coordinated groups of robotic units** operating under shared objectives or distributed control.

**Inheritance rule:**  
TS-R2 **inherits all TS-R1 constraints** without exception.

**Non-negotiable rule:**  
No fleet behaviour may weaken the most restrictive unit-level constraint.

TS-R2 may only:
• Introduce stricter coordination rules  
• Add redundancy and enforcement  
• Increase human visibility  

Averaging down safety is forbidden.

---

## 8. TS-R3 — AUTONOMY CEILING SYSTEMS

**System class definition:**  
TS-R3 governs robotic systems operating at or near the **maximum permissible autonomy boundary**.

**Mandatory controls:**  
• Hard autonomy ceilings  
• Explicit downgrade paths  
• Continuous human visibility  
• Immediate halt authority  

**Default posture:**  
Restrictive, permission-based, revocable.

No TS-R3 system may exceed declared autonomy limits.

---

## 9. TS-INFRA — CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS

**System class definition:**  
TS-INFRA governs AI or robotic systems controlling **energy, payments, identity, transport, water, or communications infrastructure**.

**Mandatory requirements:**  
• Hardware-attested integrity  
• Fail-safe governance modes  
• Jurisdiction-aware receipts  
• Regulator-replayable audit trails  

Irreversible actions without verified governance state are prohibited.

---

## 10. TS-DEF — DEFENCE, MILITARY, AND SPACE SYSTEMS

**System class definition:**  
TS-DEF governs systems used in **defence, military, space, or national security contexts**.

**Default state:**  
Not licensed.

**When explicitly permitted:**  
• Absolute human command authority  
• Receipt-bound chain of custody  
• Zero self-delegation  
• Highest audit tier  

TS-DEF systems require sovereign approval and classified licensing.

---

## 11. GOVERNANCE DASHBOARD BINDING RULE

Governance dashboards govern **certified systems of a declared class only**.

There is:
• No universal dashboard  
• No class-agnostic control plane  

Dashboard scope is legally constrained by system class.

---

## 12. STATUTORY EFFECT

Any document, product, dashboard, or claim that:
• Omits system class  
• Blurs class boundaries  
• Applies governance generically  

is **non-compliant**, **non-certifiable**, and **void** under TS-Ω.
