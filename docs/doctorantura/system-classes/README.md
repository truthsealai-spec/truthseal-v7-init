## CORE PURPOSE — WHY TRUTHSEAL™ EXISTS

TruthSeal™ exists to make advanced artificial intelligence, artificial general intelligence, and robotic systems **safe to operate in the real world**.

Safety, within TruthSeal™, does not mean performance optimisation, ethical intent, or statistical confidence.
Safety means that a system **cannot cause unacceptable harm**, even under stress, drift, misuse, or adversarial pressure.

This Doctorantura Edition defines how TruthSeal™ delivers **continuous, enforceable safety** for systems whose decisions can affect:
• human life
• physical environments
• legal rights
• financial stability
• national and institutional security

Every concept, system class, and service defined herein exists to prevent unsafe outcomes before they occur.

## WHAT “SYSTEM SAFETY” MEANS IN TRUTHSEAL™

In TruthSeal™, safety is a **structural property**, not a promise.

A system is considered safe only if:
• its actions are bounded by enforceable limits
• unsafe states are detectable in real time
• irreversible actions require explicit human authority
• unsafe behaviour cannot be silently ignored or excused
• accountability is provable after the fact

TruthSeal™ governs **decision-capable systems**, not generic software.
If a system can decide, act, or trigger consequences, it must be safe by design — not by assumption.

---

## GOVERNED SYSTEM CLASS FAMILIES (SAFETY SCOPE)

TruthSeal™ defines internal system classes to match **different categories of safety risk**.
Each class represents a distinct safety profile, governance load, and enforcement requirement.

These are **service categories**, not abstract labels.

---

### TS-AI — Safety-Governed Artificial Intelligence Systems

TS-AI systems are non-general artificial intelligence systems whose decisions can still cause material harm if unchecked.

Examples include:
• financial decision engines
• infrastructure optimisation systems
• automated control and routing systems

TruthSeal™ safety governance for TS-AI ensures:
• bounded decision scope
• prevention of unsafe optimisation shortcuts
• continuous detection of integrity degradation
• human-visible audit trails for all critical decisions

The objective is to prevent local failures from cascading into systemic harm.

---

### TS-AGI — Safety-Governed Artificial General Intelligence Systems

TS-AGI systems are capable of cross-domain reasoning, autonomous planning, and adaptive strategy formation.

These systems pose **existential and systemic safety risks** if coherence degrades or authority boundaries are unclear.

TruthSeal™ safety governance for TS-AGI exists to ensure that:
• intelligence never implies permission to act
• unsafe escalation is blocked before execution
• long-horizon drift is detected and contained
• irreversible outcomes require explicit, accountable human authorisation

The purpose of this service is not limitation of intelligence, but **prevention of unsafe autonomy**.

---

### TS-R — Safety-Governed Robotic Systems

TS-R systems are embodied systems capable of physical actuation.

This includes:
• TS-R1 — single robotic units
• TS-R2 — fleet and swarm robotics
• TS-R3 — autonomy ceilings and actuation limits

TruthSeal™ robotic safety governance ensures:
• safe-stop behaviour under uncertainty
• strict separation between perception, decision, and actuation
• prohibition of unsafe autonomous escalation
• immediate human notification when safety margins degrade

Physical safety is enforced as law, not as best practice.

---

### TS-INFRA — Safety-Governed Critical Infrastructure Systems

TS-INFRA systems operate within essential services such as:
• energy
• water
• payments
• transport
• identity and civic infrastructure

Failures in these systems can cause widespread societal harm.

TruthSeal™ governance ensures:
• continuous safety visibility
• prevention of unsafe automated overrides
• guaranteed human intervention capability
• immutable records for post-incident accountability

---

### TS-DEF — Safety-Governed Defence, Space, and National Security Systems

TS-DEF systems operate where failure can cause irreversible geopolitical or physical harm.

TruthSeal™ governance for this class enforces:
• the strictest authority hierarchy
• zero tolerance for unsafe autonomous action
• explicit escalation and halt mechanisms
• permanent auditability of all decisions and attempted actions

Safety takes precedence over performance, speed, or optimisation.

---

## SERVICE CLARITY FOR CLIENTS

TruthSeal™ does not offer generic “AI safety tools”.

TruthSeal™ provides **safety-governed system services**, each defined by:
• the type of system being governed
• the safety risks being mitigated
• the enforcement mechanisms applied
• the human authority model retained
• the audit and accountability guarantees delivered

Different organisations engage different system classes depending on the level of risk they operate under.

---

## CLIENT INTENT & TRANSPARENCY

This Doctorantura Edition exists so that future clients can clearly understand:
• what safety risks TruthSeal™ addresses
• what actions are prevented by design
• what responsibilities remain with the organisation
• what failures are structurally impossible

Nothing in TruthSeal™ safety governance relies on trust.
Everything relies on enforceable structure.
