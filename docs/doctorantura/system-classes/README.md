## CORE PURPOSE — WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ PROVIDES

TruthSeal™ provides **continuous, law-bound auditing and enforcement of coherence** for artificial intelligence, artificial general intelligence, and robotic systems operating in the real world.

The primary service of TruthSeal™ is **not generic safety tooling**.  
The primary service is **measurable, enforceable coherence governance**, delivered as a 24/7 operational layer that audits, constrains, and records how intelligent systems reason, decide, and act.

Safety is the **mandatory outcome** of coherence enforced under law.  
It is not an optional feature, a promise, or a best-effort claim.

TruthSeal™ allows governments, enterprises, institutions, courts, insurers, and operators to **select the appropriate coherence service tier** and system class, and to rely on that choice as a legally meaningful governance decision.

## WHAT “COHERENCE” MEANS IN TRUTHSEAL™

In TruthSeal™, coherence means that a system’s reasoning, intent, and action remain aligned over time with declared aims, legal constraints, and human authority.

Coherence is continuously audited and enforced under the **Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1)**:
once a safer, more coherent state is verified, the system is **not permitted to regress** into a worse or riskier state without explicit, accountable human authorisation.

TruthSeal™ does not optimise intelligence.
TruthSeal™ **governs intelligence**.

Unsafe outcomes are prevented **because incoherent execution is structurally disallowed**.

---

## COHERENCE GOVERNANCE AS A SERVICE

TruthSeal™ operates as a **coherence auditing and enforcement service**, not as embedded application logic.

Clients engage TruthSeal™ by:
• selecting a governed system class  
• selecting a coherence service tier  
• binding their systems to TruthSeal™ law and receipts  

From that point forward, coherence is:
• measured continuously  
• enforced deterministically  
• recorded immutably  
• reviewable by authorised stakeholders  

This enables organisations to demonstrate, at any time, that their AI, AGI, or robotic systems are operating within declared coherence bounds.

---

## GOVERNED SYSTEM CLASS FAMILIES (SERVICE SCOPE)

TruthSeal™ defines internal system classes to match **different coherence and risk profiles**.
Each class represents a distinct **coherence auditing service**, enforcement depth, and threat model.

These are **service categories offered by TruthSeal™**, not generic industry labels.

### TS-AI — Coherence-Governed Artificial Intelligence Systems

TS-AI covers non-general AI systems whose decisions can materially affect financial, operational, or institutional outcomes.

TruthSeal™ provides:
• continuous coherence auditing of decision pipelines  
• enforcement of non-regression under LEI = 1  
• detection of integrity drift and optimisation shortcuts  
• full decision receipt trails for review and audit  

Safety is achieved by ensuring that local incoherence cannot accumulate into systemic failure.

---

### TS-AGI — Coherence-Governed Artificial General Intelligence Systems

TS-AGI covers systems capable of cross-domain reasoning, adaptive planning, and self-directed strategy.

These systems require the **highest coherence enforcement**, as intelligence alone cannot justify autonomy.

TruthSeal™ provides:
• strict separation between reasoning and execution  
• mandatory human authority for irreversible actions  
• long-horizon coherence auditing  
• enforcement against silent escalation or autonomy drift  

The service ensures that general intelligence remains governable under law at all times.

---

### TS-R — Coherence-Governed Robotic Systems

TS-R covers embodied systems capable of physical action.

This includes:
• TS-R1 — single robotic units  
• TS-R2 — coordinated fleets and swarms  
• TS-R3 — autonomy ceilings and actuation limits  

TruthSeal™ provides:
• coherence auditing between perception, intent, and actuation  
• enforcement of safe-stop and fallback laws  
• prohibition of incoherent autonomous escalation  
• human-visible intervention and receipt-backed accountability  

Physical safety emerges from enforced coherence, not behavioural assumptions.

---

### TS-INFRA — Coherence-Governed Critical Infrastructure Systems

TS-INFRA applies to systems controlling essential services such as energy, payments, transport, identity, and communications.

TruthSeal™ provides:
• coherence auditing across control loops  
• prevention of unsafe automated overrides  
• guaranteed human authority continuity  
• immutable evidence for incident review  

This service exists to ensure infrastructure decisions remain coherent under stress, attack, or failure.

---

### TS-DEF — Coherence-Governed Defence, Space, and National Security Systems

TS-DEF covers systems where incoherence can cause irreversible strategic harm.

TruthSeal™ provides:
• the strictest coherence enforcement boundaries  
• zero tolerance for unauthorised autonomous action  
• explicit escalation and halt mechanisms  
• permanent, reviewable records of all decisions and attempts  

Here, coherence enforcement is a matter of sovereign responsibility.

---

## QUANTUM & POST-QUANTUM THREAT PROTECTION

TruthSeal™ coherence services are protected against:
• quantum attacks on integrity  
• post-quantum cryptographic degradation  
• replay, rollback, and falsification attempts  

This includes enforcement layers such as:
• SLU (Sovereign Lock-Up mechanisms)  
• post-quantum receipts  
• immutable ledger anchoring  

Coherence remains enforceable even as cryptographic threat models evolve.

---

## CLIENT CLARITY & EXPECTATION

TruthSeal™ exists so that clients can know, **in advance**:
• what level of coherence governance they are purchasing  
• what incoherent behaviours are structurally prevented  
• what authority remains human  
• what evidence will exist if decisions are challenged  

Safety is not a promise.
Safety is the **provable result of enforced coherence under law**.
