**TRUTHSEAL™ DOCTORANTURA — THE SOVEREIGN ARC OF AGI FRAMEWORK v1.0
Strict Internal Doctrine — Not for Public Use**

date: 2025-12-24

---------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW — DOCTORANTURA SCOPE AND PURPOSE

This Doctorantura repository defines the binding doctrinal, legal, and technical
foundations of the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc. It is not a product manual, a
marketing document, or an implementation guide. It is the authoritative source
of law, structure, and meaning for all TruthSeal™ system classes, services,
certifications, and governance mechanisms.

Doctorantura exists to establish clarity before scale. It codifies what TruthSeal™
does, what it governs, what it explicitly does not do, and under which conditions
its services may be invoked, licensed, audited, or enforced. All public-facing
materials, dashboards, partner packs, and technical specifications derive their
legitimacy from this corpus.

This repository is written for sovereign stakeholders, regulators, institutional
clients, auditors, and internal architects. It assumes no casual readership.
Every document herein is intended to withstand legal scrutiny, regulatory review,
and adversarial interpretation.

Doctorantura is the law-before-product layer of TruthSeal™.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

GOVERNED SYSTEM CLASSES — DECLARATION

TruthSeal™ governs explicitly declared classes of artificial intelligence,
artificial general intelligence, robotic, infrastructure, and defence systems.
These classes are not abstract categories. They are operational service domains
defined, bounded, and enforced by TruthSeal™ under the Law of Ethical
Irreversibility (LEI = 1).

TruthSeal™ does not certify “technology” in general. It governs the behaviour,
decision authority, execution boundaries, and auditability of systems operating
continuously in real-world environments.

Each system class represents a distinct governance surface, risk profile,
licensing obligation, and service tier. No system may claim TruthSeal™ governance
unless it is explicitly mapped to one or more of the classes defined below.

The canonical system classes are:

- TS-AI — Artificial Intelligence systems (non-general, task-bounded)
- TS-AGI — Artificial General Intelligence systems (open-ended reasoning systems)
- TS-R — Robotic systems (single, fleet, and autonomy-ceiling governed)
- TS-INFRA — Critical infrastructure control systems
- TS-DEF — Defence, military, space, and national security systems

Each class is governed independently and may require separate certification,
licensing, and operational dashboards.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

SERVICE INTENT — WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ PROVIDES

TruthSeal™ is not a safety product in the conventional sense. Safety is a
consequence, not the service.

The core service provided by TruthSeal™ is continuous, verifiable governance of
coherence, authority, and action for high-impact intelligent systems operating
24/7. This includes:

- Independent auditing of decision coherence
- Enforcement of irreversible responsibility at execution boundaries
- Continuous issuance of cryptographic decision receipts
- Governance dashboards for lawful human oversight
- Protection against quantum and post-quantum attack vectors
- Formal containment and halt mechanisms for incoherent behaviour

TruthSeal™ enables governments, enterprises, courts, insurers, and institutions
to deploy advanced systems while retaining lawful authority, accountability, and
audit continuity.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

LICENSING AND SERVICE TIERS — PRINCIPLE

TruthSeal™ services are delivered through explicitly defined service tiers.
Each tier specifies:

- Which system classes are covered
- Which governance mechanisms are active
- Which dashboards and control planes are mandatory
- Which audit obligations apply
- Which protections against advanced attacks are enforced

Service tiers are not cosmetic. They determine legal responsibility, operational
permissions, and liability boundaries for the client.

No client receives “everything by default.” Scope is intentional and explicit.

Tier definitions are maintained separately and referenced by system class and
deployment type.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

GOVERNANCE DASHBOARDS — STATUTORY ROLE

Any system governed under TruthSeal™ must expose a governance dashboard appropriate
to its system class and service tier.

The dashboard is not an analytics interface. It is the single authoritative
human-visible governance surface through which certification status, decision
receipts, escalation events, and lawful interventions are exercised.

Dashboard actions constitute legal events. All actions are receipted, attributable,
and irreversible once executed.

No governed system may operate without its required dashboard.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

DOCTORANTURA STRUCTURE — NAVIGATION

This repository is organised by doctrinal function and system class. Key areas
include:

- Chapters — formal doctrine and law
- Robotics — TS-R global law and operational profiles
- Governance — dashboards, enforcement layers, and authority models
- Certification — lifecycle, audits, and mark usage
- Ledger doctrine — receipts, anchoring, and evidentiary continuity

Each document declares its scope, authority, and binding relationships explicitly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

AUTHORITY AND PRECEDENCE

Doctorantura documents take precedence over all other TruthSeal™ materials.
If a public document, dashboard, or partner artifact conflicts with Doctorantura,
the Doctorantura text governs.

No deviation, reinterpretation, or partial adoption is permitted without an
explicitly recorded amendment under TruthSeal™ governance procedures.
