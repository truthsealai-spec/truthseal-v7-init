**TRUTHSEAL™ DOCTORANTURA — SYSTEM CLASS SERVICES INDEX v1.0
Client-Facing Governance & Licensing Definition
Strictly Defined Service Classes — Not Internal Doctrine**

**date: 2025-12-24**

## PREAMBLE — WHAT THIS DOCUMENT IS

This document defines the **official system classes and service categories** governed by TruthSeal™.

It exists for **clients, regulators, insurers, courts, enterprises, governments, and strategic partners** to understand exactly:
• which types of systems TruthSeal™ governs,
• what protections and guarantees are provided,
• what is explicitly excluded,
• and how licensing and accountability differ by system class.

This document does **not** describe internal architecture, enforcement mechanics, or proprietary execution plans.  
It defines **service scope**, **governance guarantees**, and **commercial boundaries**.

TruthSeal™ does not govern “everything”.
It governs **explicitly declared system classes under explicit service agreements**.

---

## SYSTEM CLASS 1 — TS-AI  
### Artificial Intelligence Systems (Narrow / Task-Bound)

TS-AI governs **non-general artificial intelligence systems** operating within clearly defined functional boundaries.

These include, but are not limited to:
• decision-support systems,
• forecasting and optimisation engines,
• automated compliance tools,
• classification and recommendation systems,
• constrained control software without autonomous goal formation.

TS-AI services provide:
• integrity receipts for critical decisions,
• audit-ready traceability of model behaviour,
• human-authorised override mechanisms,
• non-repudiation for regulated outputs,
• contractual clarity for liability allocation.

TS-AI does **not**:
• certify consciousness or intent,
• permit autonomous escalation of authority,
• replace legal or human responsibility,
• govern open-ended agency.

TS-AI is typically licensed for **enterprises, regulators, insurers, courts, and financial institutions** requiring verifiable AI governance without autonomy claims.

---

## SYSTEM CLASS 2 — TS-AGI  
### Artificial General Intelligence Systems

TS-AGI governs **explicitly declared Artificial General Intelligence systems** capable of:
• cross-domain reasoning,
• long-horizon planning,
• self-directed optimisation,
• and adaptive goal pursuit beyond narrow tasks.

TS-AGI services are **scarce by design**.
Only a limited percentage of deployed systems may qualify, subject to continuous oversight.

TS-AGI services provide:
• continuous coherence measurement,
• mandatory human authority boundaries,
• irreversible accountability records,
• escalation and suspension guarantees,
• court-verifiable operational history.

TS-AGI does **not**:
• grant sovereignty to machines,
• remove human supremacy,
• permit unbounded autonomy,
• operate without explicit contractual custody.

TS-AGI is intended for **state actors, frontier research entities, and highly regulated sovereign deployments** only.

## SYSTEM CLASS 3 — TS-R  
### Robotic & Physical Actuation Systems

TS-R governs **physical systems capable of acting in the real world**, including:
• humanoid robots,
• industrial robotics,
• autonomous vehicles,
• aerial, maritime, and underwater systems.

TS-R services ensure:
• strict action boundaries,
• human override supremacy,
• safety-first operational envelopes,
• immutable actuation records,
• jurisdiction-aware accountability.

TS-R is subdivided into:
• TS-R1 — Single Robot Systems  
• TS-R2 — Fleet & Swarm Systems  
• TS-R3 — Autonomy Ceiling & Hard Limits  

No TS-R system may operate without a declared human authority model.

TS-R does **not** permit:
• uncontrolled physical autonomy,
• dilution of responsibility,
• silent actuation,
• collective override of individual safety constraints.

---

## SYSTEM CLASS 4 — TS-INFRA  
### Critical Infrastructure Control Systems

TS-INFRA governs AI and automated systems controlling:
• energy grids,
• payments and settlement rails,
• identity systems,
• communications infrastructure,
• national logistics and mobility layers.

TS-INFRA services provide:
• continuous integrity assurance,
• fail-safe governance modes,
• regulator-ready audit outputs,
• incident containment guarantees,
• cross-institution accountability alignment.

TS-INFRA is licensed exclusively for **critical infrastructure operators and sovereign institutions**.

---

## SYSTEM CLASS 5 — TS-DEF  
### Defence, Space & National Security Systems

TS-DEF governs **classified and high-risk systems** operating in:
• defence,
• space,
• intelligence,
• and national security contexts.

TS-DEF services are **restricted, limited, and scarcity-controlled**.

They provide:
• maximum human command authority,
• irreversible action accountability,
• compartmentalised governance,
• sovereign-grade evidence trails.

TS-DEF services are **never public**, **never open**, and **never transferable**.

---

## FINAL NOTICE — LICENSING & SERVICE CLARITY

Each TruthSeal™ system class:
• is licensed separately,
• carries different obligations and guarantees,
• has explicit inclusions and exclusions,
• and is priced according to risk, scarcity, and governance load.

Clients receive **clarity before commitment**.
No hidden scope. No ambiguous authority.
