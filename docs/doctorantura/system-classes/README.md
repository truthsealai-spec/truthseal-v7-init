## PURPOSE OF THIS DOCTORANTURA EDITION

This Doctorantura Edition defines the legally governed intelligence and robotic system classes that TruthSeal™ designs, certifies, and operates as long-horizon governance services for high-risk environments.

It exists to provide absolute clarity to governments, institutions, courts, insurers, infrastructure operators, and strategic enterprises regarding:

• what categories of artificial intelligence and robotic systems TruthSeal™ governs  
• what authority boundaries apply to each system class  
• what protections, obligations, and guarantees are delivered  
• what is explicitly excluded from scope  

This edition is not marketing material.  
It is a service-definition and governance doctrine.

## WHAT “SYSTEM” MEANS IN TRUTHSEAL™

Within TruthSeal™, a “system” refers exclusively to an explicitly governed artificial intelligence or robotic operational stack that:

• executes decisions with real-world consequence  
• operates continuously or semi-continuously  
• interacts with legal, financial, physical, or sovereign domains  
• requires enforceable human authority and auditability  

TruthSeal™ does not govern generic software, tools, or analytics products.  
TruthSeal™ governs decision-capable intelligence systems.

## GOVERNED SYSTEM CLASS FAMILIES

TruthSeal™ defines and governs the following internal system class families as distinct service categories.

Each class represents a different governance load, risk profile, and certification depth.

### TS-AI — Artificial Intelligence Systems

This class covers bounded, non-general artificial intelligence systems operating under defined task constraints.

Examples include:
• decision support engines  
• optimisation and control systems  
• predictive infrastructure models  

These systems do not possess general reasoning autonomy but can still create material risk if ungoverned.

---

### TS-AGI — Artificial General Intelligence Systems

This class covers systems capable of cross-domain reasoning, self-directed planning, and adaptive strategy formation.

These systems present elevated systemic risk when coherence, intent alignment, or reversibility controls are absent.

TruthSeal™ governance for TS-AGI systems exists to ensure that:
• action authority is never inferred from intelligence alone  
• coherence degradation is detected and halted  
• irreversible outcomes require explicit human legitimacy  

The service is comprehensive because failure impact is extreme, not because access is limited.

---

### TS-R — Robotic Systems

This class governs embodied systems capable of physical actuation.

It includes:
• TS-R1 — single robotic units  
• TS-R2 — fleet and swarm robotics  
• TS-R3 — autonomy ceiling and actuation limits  

Robotic governance is enforced at both decision and execution layers, with strict fallback and human mandate requirements.

---

### TS-INFRA — Critical Infrastructure Systems

This class covers AI or AGI systems embedded in essential services such as:
• energy  
• water  
• payments  
• transport  
• identity and border control  

These systems require continuous governance visibility and immediate intervention capability.

---

### TS-DEF — Defence, Space, and National Security Systems

This class applies to intelligence systems operating in military, space, or national security contexts.

These systems are governed under the most restrictive authority and audit conditions, with explicit escalation, containment, and halt doctrines.

---

## SERVICE MODEL CLARITY

TruthSeal™ does not sell software licenses.

TruthSeal™ provides governed system services, each defined by:
• system class  
• governance depth  
• enforcement mechanisms  
• audit and receipt guarantees  
• human authority model  

Different organisations subscribe to different system classes and governance tiers depending on operational risk and legal obligation.

---

## CLIENT INTENT

This Doctorantura Edition exists so that future clients can understand, before engagement:

• which system class applies to them  
• what TruthSeal™ will enforce  
• what responsibilities they retain  
• what outcomes are prevented  

Nothing in this edition is implicit.
Nothing is left to interpretation.
