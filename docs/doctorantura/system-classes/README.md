## PREAMBLE — PURPOSE AND SCOPE

This document defines the Doctorantura layer of the TruthSeal™ framework.  
Doctorantura is the internal, sovereign doctrine that specifies how TruthSeal™ governs, audits, and enforces coherence across advanced artificial intelligence, artificial general intelligence, and robotic systems operating continuously in real-world environments.

TruthSeal™ is not a model developer, automation vendor, or analytics provider.  
TruthSeal™ operates as a **law-bound coherence auditing, enforcement, and governance system** applied to intelligence systems that may exert real-world, legal, financial, physical, or strategic impact.

This framework exists to ensure that intelligent systems remain **coherent, accountable, auditable, and bound by irreversible ethical constraints**, enforced at operational, cryptographic, and governance levels.

Doctorantura defines what systems are governed, how they are classified, what services are provided, and under which lawful conditions those services may be deployed.

---

## GOVERNED SYSTEM CLASSES (AUTHORITATIVE DEFINITIONS)

TruthSeal™ governs explicitly defined system classes.  
Each class represents a category of continuously operating intelligence or actuation systems that require persistent coherence auditing and lawful control.

The following system classes are **exhaustive and mandatory** within the TruthSeal™ framework.

---

### TS-AI — ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS

TS-AI systems include narrow and domain-specific artificial intelligence operating continuously or at scale.  
These systems may include decision engines, optimisation systems, large language models in production, automated financial analysis tools, logistics optimisation platforms, legal reasoning systems, or policy analysis engines.

TruthSeal™ services for TS-AI focus on:
• Continuous coherence auditing  
• Decision traceability and receipt generation  
• Detection of drift, contradiction, or governance bypass  
• Law-bound operational enforcement under LEI = 1  

TS-AI governance ensures that outputs remain consistent with declared intent, authorised scope, and irreversible accountability, even under distribution shift, adversarial input, or operational pressure.

---

### TS-AGI — ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS

TS-AGI systems refer strictly to **Artificial General Intelligence**, defined as systems capable of cross-domain reasoning, adaptive goal formation, and autonomous strategy synthesis across multiple environments.

TruthSeal™ does not certify intelligence claims.  
TruthSeal™ **audits and governs operational AGI behaviour** once such systems are deployed or simulated in persistent environments.

TruthSeal™ services for TS-AGI include:
• Continuous coherence auditing across reasoning chains  
• Enforcement of irreversible ethical constraints (LEI = 1)  
• Action gating, receipt-bound execution, and human authority preservation  
• Protection against quantum and post-quantum adversarial manipulation  

TS-AGI governance exists to prevent irreversible harm, authority dilution, or unaccountable autonomy once general intelligence systems interact with reality.

---

### TS-R — ROBOTIC SYSTEMS (GLOBAL ROBOTICS LAW)

TS-R systems include all robotic and cyber-physical systems capable of physical actuation in the real world.  
This includes humanoid robots, industrial robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, underwater systems, and hybrid robotic swarms.

Robotics systems are governed under a strict statutory hierarchy:

• TS-R1 — Single robotic units  
• TS-R2 — Fleet and swarm robotic systems  
• TS-R3 — Autonomy ceiling and actuation limits  

TruthSeal™ services for TS-R systems focus on:
• Actuation coherence and action legitimacy  
• Human override enforcement  
• Prevention of emergent collective behaviour beyond lawful limits  
• Continuous auditability of physical actions and command chains  

No robotic system may operate autonomously under TruthSeal™ without explicit coherence enforcement and statutory binding.

---

### TS-INFRA — CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS

TS-INFRA systems include intelligence or control systems governing energy grids, water systems, transport networks, financial infrastructure, communications systems, and other critical societal infrastructure.

TruthSeal™ governance ensures:
• Continuous coherence of control decisions  
• Protection against cascading failures and hidden drift  
• Receipt-backed intervention authority  
• Legal-grade audit continuity for regulators and operators  

These systems are governed to prevent silent failure, unaccountable optimisation, or systemic instability.

---

### TS-DEF — DEFENCE, SPACE, AND NATIONAL-SECURITY SYSTEMS

TS-DEF systems include intelligence, coordination, and control systems used in defence, space operations, and national security contexts.

TruthSeal™ services in this class are strictly law-bound and sovereignty-preserving.  
They focus on:
• Absolute human authority retention  
• Prevention of autonomous escalation  
• Cryptographic and post-quantum integrity  
• Full decision accountability across time  

No TS-DEF system may self-authorise irreversible actions.

---

## TRUTHSEAL™ SERVICES AND LICENSING PRINCIPLE

TruthSeal™ provides **governance, coherence auditing, and enforcement services**, not generic software features.

Services are licensed according to:
• System class (TS-AI, TS-AGI, TS-R, TS-INFRA, TS-DEF)  
• Operational scale and exposure  
• Required coherence guarantees  
• Jurisdictional and regulatory context  

Each service tier explicitly defines:
• What systems are covered  
• What actions are governed or blocked  
• What guarantees are provided  
• What risks are mitigated  

This transparency allows governments, institutions, courts, insurers, enterprises, and operators to select appropriate governance coverage with full awareness of obligations and protections.

---

## DOCTORANTURA STATUS

Doctorantura documents are **strictly internal doctrine**.  
They define the authoritative meaning, scope, and enforcement logic of TruthSeal™ services.

Public-facing materials may reference Doctorantura outcomes but may not reproduce or dilute its definitions.
