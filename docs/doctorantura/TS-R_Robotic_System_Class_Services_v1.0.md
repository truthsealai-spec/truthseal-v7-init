## TS-R — ROBOTIC SYSTEM CLASS SERVICES

### 1. SYSTEM CLASS DEFINITION (WHAT IS GOVERNED)

The TS-R System Class governs robotic and cyber-physical systems that are capable of executing physical actions in the real world. These systems translate digital decisions into mechanical, electrical, or kinetic outcomes that can affect people, property, infrastructure, or environments.

TS-R applies to any system that includes sensors, actuators, motors, control loops, or physical execution pathways. The defining characteristic is not intelligence level, but the capacity to cause irreversible real-world change.

Robotic systems governed under TS-R may include industrial robots, service robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, humanoid platforms, medical robotics, logistics automation, agricultural robotics, and defense-adjacent robotic systems.

Purely simulated agents, digital twins, and non-actuating software systems are explicitly excluded from TS-R unless directly connected to a physical execution layer.

TruthSeal™ governance binds robotic systems at the point where intent becomes motion.

### 2. ROBOTIC SUB-CLASSES (R1 / R2 / R3)

TS-R is divided into three operational sub-classes based on autonomy, scope, and risk exposure.

TS-R1 governs single-unit robotic systems operating in controlled environments with bounded task authority. These systems may execute predefined actions but cannot independently expand mission scope.

TS-R2 governs multi-unit or fleet robotic systems where coordination, delegation, or collective behavior exists. This includes swarm robotics, warehouse fleets, delivery systems, and coordinated autonomous platforms.

TS-R3 governs high-autonomy robotic systems capable of extended operation, environmental adaptation, or safety-critical execution. These systems demand the highest level of governance oversight due to their irreversible impact potential.

Each sub-class carries progressively stricter governance, audit, and intervention requirements.

---

### 3. GOVERNANCE SCOPE (WHAT IS VERIFIED)

TruthSeal™ governs robotic execution authority, action legitimacy, escalation boundaries, and intervention controls. Governance applies before, during, and after physical actuation.

Verification ensures that robotic actions remain within declared authority envelopes and do not exceed permitted operational scope.

The system enforces deterministic action gating, escalation classification, and authority confirmation prior to execution of high-impact actions.

Robotic systems may not self-authorise new behaviors, environments, or objectives without explicit governance approval.

All physical actions are treated as legally consequential events.

---

### 4. SAFETY AS STRUCTURAL ENFORCEMENT

TS-R safety is not a feature layer. It is enforced through structural constraints on action execution.

TruthSeal™ prevents unsafe robotic behavior by disallowing illegitimate action paths rather than attempting post-hoc correction.

Emergency halt, human override, and containment mechanisms are mandatory for all TS-R systems.

Fail-open behavior is prohibited. Loss of governance visibility forces systems into safe containment modes.

Safety is therefore provable, not promised.

---

### 5. CLIENT SERVICES DELIVERED

Clients receive continuous governance oversight of robotic execution, including real-time visibility into action authority, escalation state, and intervention readiness.

TruthSeal™ provides auditable proof that robotic actions were lawful, authorised, and governed at the time of execution.

This enables deployment of robotics in regulated, public, industrial, medical, and sensitive environments with institutional confidence.

Services support regulatory compliance, insurance underwriting, incident investigation, and judicial review.

---

### 6. CLIENT ELIGIBILITY AND DEPLOYMENT CONTEXT

TS-R services are designed for manufacturers, operators, logistics providers, healthcare institutions, infrastructure operators, public agencies, and defence-adjacent organisations.

Clients must declare robotic scope, autonomy level, physical environment, and escalation authority.

Any expansion of robotic capability or environment requires updated governance declaration.

Unauthorised modification voids service coverage.

---

### 7. LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS

TS-R does not certify mechanical design quality, hardware reliability, or manufacturing standards.

TruthSeal™ governs authority, accountability, and execution legitimacy — not engineering fitness.

Responsibility for lawful deployment remains with the operator.

---

### 8. BINDING AUTHORITY

This document constitutes binding doctrine under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc.

Any robotic system operating under the TS-R designation without full compliance is non-conforming by definition.
