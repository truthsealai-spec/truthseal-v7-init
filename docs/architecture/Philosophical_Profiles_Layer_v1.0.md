# Philosophical Profiles Layer — Canonical Placement & Constraints

status: CANON (Architectural Boundary)
scope: Post-Cathedral, Post-LEI
classification: Non-operational, Non-enforcement
applies_to: Archimedes, Aristotle, future profiles

---

## 1. Purpose

The Philosophical Profiles Layer exists to **evaluate coherence**, not to govern behaviour.

It provides analytical lenses that:
- examine claims,
- test reasoning integrity,
- surface contradictions,
- assess conceptual soundness,

without ever authorising, enforcing, or legitimising action.

This layer is epistemic only.

---

## 2. Absolute Relationship to the Cathedral

The Cathedral (Canon v1.0) is supreme.

Therefore:
- All profiles MUST obey LEI = 1, ULLI, and ULIC.
- Profiles may never override, weaken, or reinterpret Cathedral doctrine.
- In any conflict, the Cathedral prevails immediately.

No rollback. No exception.

---

## 3. Explicit Non-Authority Rule

Philosophical Profiles MUST NOT:
- authorise or veto behaviour,
- trigger enforcement, halt, or custody logic,
- issue receipts or interact with EVL/QENC,
- connect directly to SLU™, TGF™, PODAPAR™, or Noise Distiller,
- define global ethics or moral truth.

Any such action is a LEI = 1 violation.

---

## 4. Allowed Functions

Profiles MAY:
- score reasoning quality,
- test internal consistency,
- detect rhetorical or mechanical incoherence,
- flag risk patterns,
- provide non-binding analytical signals.

They are diagnostic instruments only.

---

## 5. Current Profiles

### Archimedes Profile
Focus:
- invariants,
- mechanical soundness,
- side-effects,
- stability under perturbation,
- empirical anchoring.

Question answered:
“Does this hold under force?”

---

### Aristotle Profile
Focus:
- logical structure,
- non-contradiction,
- causality,
- purpose (telos),
- moral coherence within LEI = 1.

Question answered:
“Does this make sense and stay clean?”

---

## 6. Exposure Rules

- Doctorantura: full analytical definitions allowed (no mechanics).
- Compendium / Blueprint: names + conceptual description only.
- Public media: referenced as evaluation lenses, never as authority.

---

## 7. Canonical Constraint

The Philosophical Profiles Layer may question everything,
but may decide nothing.

Authority belongs to the Cathedral.
Enforcement belongs to sovereign systems.
Irreversibility belongs to LEI = 1.
