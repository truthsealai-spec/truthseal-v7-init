## 1. Purpose

This document defines the public conceptual standard for the
Robotic Identity and Lifecycle Registry (RILR) under the TruthSeal™
Sovereign Arc of AGI.

Its purpose is to establish that every embodied intelligent machine
operating under AI or AGI governance is treated as a registered,
accountable entity across its entire operational life.

This registry exists to ensure continuity of responsibility,
traceability of behaviour, and lawful human accountability for
all moving machines governed by artificial intelligence.

---

## 2. Scope of Application

The Robotic Identity and Lifecycle Registry applies to:

• TS-R1 — Humanoid robotic systems  
• TS-R2 — All non-humanoid embodied intelligence, including but not limited to:
  drones, autonomous vehicles, underwater systems, industrial robots,
  mobile infrastructure, and future robotic morphologies

Any machine capable of autonomous or semi-autonomous action under AI or AGI
must fall within this registry.

---

## 3. Robotic Civil Identity

Each registered robot is assigned a unique Sovereign Robotic Identifier.

This identifier:
• is permanent,
• is non-transferable,
• persists across ownership changes,
• and cannot be reset, erased, or duplicated.

The identity functions analogously to a vehicle number plate,
but with stronger accountability constraints due to the nature
of intelligent agency.

---

## 4. Lifecycle Continuity

Every robot operates within a continuous lifecycle record that includes:

• manufacturing origin,
• deployment status,
• software and intelligence updates,
• maintenance and repair events,
• ownership transfers,
• and decommissioning.

Lifecycle continuity ensures that responsibility cannot be fragmented,
hidden, or discarded through technical modification or resale.

---

## 5. Receipt Alignment (Conceptual)

All intelligence updates and behavioural changes are conceptually linked
to verifiable receipts issued under the Sovereign Arc.

Receipts serve as public proof that:
• an authorised human mandate existed,
• a registered system executed the action,
• and accountability remains intact.

No receipt mechanics are described in this document.

---

## 6. Licensing and Operational Validity

Robots governed under this framework operate only within a valid
licensing state.

Licensing status is:
• time-bound,
• jurisdiction-aware,
• and subject to renewal or suspension.

An unlicensed or expired system is considered non-compliant
with the Sovereign Arc.

---

## 7. Insurance and Risk Attribution

Operational robots are expected to maintain active insurance coverage
linked to their sovereign identity.

Insurance follows the robot, not merely the owner,
ensuring that liability remains traceable across transfers and usage contexts.

---

## 8. Ownership Transfer and Custody

Ownership changes must be registered.

Responsibility cannot be voided through sale, modification,
or third-party repair.

Custodial Entities performing maintenance, retrofit, or repair
are bound by the Sovereign Arc and must preserve identity,
receipt continuity, and lifecycle integrity.

---

## 9. Relationship to the Sovereign Arc

The Robotic Identity and Lifecycle Registry completes the external
governance loop of the Sovereign Arc of AGI.

It ensures that:
• human intent initiates action,
• machine execution is traceable,
• and responsibility returns to human institutions.

This registry enables lawful deployment of intelligent machines
at planetary scale without erosion of accountability.

---

## 10. Public Boundary

This document defines what exists, not how it is enforced.

All implementation details, enforcement mechanisms,
identity generation logic, and revocation procedures
exist exclusively under Doctorantura custody
and are not exposed in public materials.
