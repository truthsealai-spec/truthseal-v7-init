## 1. WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ IS

TruthSeal™ is an organisation that provides governance, audit, enforcement, and accountability systems for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems.

TruthSeal™ does not develop, train, deploy, or operate AI or AGI systems.
It provides the independent governance infrastructure that ensures such systems remain lawful, coherent, provable, and human-accountable at all times.

TruthSeal™ exists to make the operation of AI, AGI, and autonomous systems compatible with legal, regulatory, and institutional oversight.

---

## 2. WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ GOVERNS

TruthSeal™ governs the behaviour, outputs, and actions of external AI, AGI, and robotic systems created and operated by others.

Governance applies to:
• decision-making outputs,
• automated or semi-automated actions,
• physical actuation via robotics,
• long-running or adaptive intelligence systems,
• systems operating at scale or with material real-world impact.

TruthSeal™ governance ensures that no intelligent system operates without traceable authority, attributable responsibility, and verifiable audit records.

---

## 3. WHY TRUTHSEAL™ EXISTS

Advanced AI and AGI systems can act at speeds, scales, and levels of complexity that exceed traditional oversight mechanisms.

TruthSeal™ exists to ensure that:
• human authority remains supreme,
• accountability cannot be displaced onto machines,
• decisions and actions remain provable after the fact,
• responsibility can be enforced by courts, regulators, and institutions.

TruthSeal™ provides the missing governance layer between intelligence systems and real-world consequences.

---

## 4. HOW TRUTHSEAL™ OPERATES

TruthSeal™ operates through licensed governance layers applied to external systems.

These layers include:
• audit systems that record and reconstruct decisions,
• enforcement systems that constrain or gate actions,
• accountability systems that bind authority to liability,
• escalation systems that enable lawful human intervention.

TruthSeal™ governance is continuous, auditable, and legally meaningful.

---

## 5. SYSTEM CLASSES COVERED

TruthSeal™ governance applies across defined system classes, including:
• AI systems used for analysis, decision support, or automation,
• AGI systems capable of general or multi-domain reasoning,
• autonomous robotic systems with physical actuation,
• defence, military, space, and sovereign-critical systems.

Each system class is governed under explicitly defined scopes and service tiers.

---

## 6. SERVICE TIERS AND ASSURANCE

TruthSeal™ offers tiered governance coverage aligned to system risk and impact.

Service tiers define:
• which governance systems are active,
• what audit depth applies,
• what enforcement mechanisms are enabled,
• what guarantees institutions may rely upon.

Higher-risk systems require deeper governance coverage.
Misuse of tiers outside declared scope is prohibited.

---

## 7. ROLE OF REGULATORS AND COURTS

TruthSeal™ enables regulators, courts, and oversight bodies to:
• inspect audit records,
• verify accountability chains,
• assess compliance with declared governance scope,
• enforce responsibility where violations occur.

TruthSeal™ does not replace regulators.
It provides the technical and evidentiary foundation that regulation requires.

This document is the authoritative public reference for understanding the role, scope, and purpose of TruthSeal™.

In case of conflict, this document supersedes marketing material, presentations, or informal explanations.

Interpretation must align with declared system classes, licensed service tiers, and active governance layers.
