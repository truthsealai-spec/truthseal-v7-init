**TS-R — ROBOTIC SYSTEM CLASS**

────────────────────────────────────────
**1. SYSTEM CLASS DEFINITION (WHAT IS GOVERNED)**

The TS-R System Class governs robotic and cyber-physical systems that execute physical actions in the real world under algorithmic, AI, or AGI control.

This includes any system capable of converting digital decisions into mechanical, electrical, kinetic, or environmental effects that may impact people, property, infrastructure, or ecosystems.

TS-R applies regardless of embodiment, mobility, or autonomy level, including stationary systems, mobile robots, industrial automation, autonomous vehicles, drones, and robotic swarms.

────────────────────────────────────────
**2. GOVERNANCE THRESHOLD**

Robotic systems introduce irreversible real-world consequences.

Accordingly, any robotic system whose actions may cause physical harm, legal exposure, financial loss, environmental damage, or public risk must operate under continuous TruthSeal™ governance.

TS-R governance is mandatory where robotic actions:
• affect public or shared environments,
• interact with humans or animals,
• operate in safety-critical or regulated domains,
• are controlled or influenced by AI or AGI systems.

────────────────────────────────────────
**3. TRUTHSEAL™ GOVERNANCE GUARANTEES**

TruthSeal™ governance under TS-R ensures that:

• Every robotic action is attributable to accountable human authority
• Control decisions and actuation paths are traceable and auditable
• Safety constraints and operational boundaries are enforceable
• Deviations, faults, or misuse are detectable and provable
• Emergency override and human intervention remain available
• Physical authority cannot be delegated to machines

Robotic autonomy never nullifies human responsibility.

────────────────────────────────────────
**4. MANDATORY SERVICE TIER ALIGNMENT**

TS-R systems require service tiers proportional to physical risk:

• Base / Standard tiers may apply only to low-risk, non-public, non-autonomous systems
• Supreme tier is mandatory for systems operating in public, industrial, or safety-critical environments
• Ultra tier is mandatory for large-scale, autonomous, or cross-jurisdiction robotic deployments

Service tier selection determines enforcement depth, audit frequency, and liability binding.

────────────────────────────────────────
**5. INTERACTION WITH AI AND AGI SYSTEMS**

Where robotic systems are controlled, assisted, or influenced by AI or AGI:

• TS-R governance must be paired with the corresponding TS-AI or TS-AGI system class
• Accountability chains must span decision, control, and actuation layers
• No separation between intelligence output and physical execution is permitted

────────────────────────────────────────
**6. REGULATORY AND INSTITUTIONAL RELIANCE**

TS-R governance enables lawful reliance by:
• workplace safety regulators,
• transport and aviation authorities,
• defence and security agencies,
• insurers and courts,
• infrastructure and city operators.

Reliance is based on provable accountability, not mechanical infallibility.

────────────────────────────────────────
**7. NON-DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY**

Under TS-R governance:
• Robots are not legal actors
• Robots cannot hold liability
• Robots cannot assume authority

Liability follows human command and system ownership.

────────────────────────────────────────
**8. SCOPE LIMITATION**

No governance, audit, enforcement, or accountability guarantee exists for:
• undeclared robotic capabilities,
• experimental or offline systems,
• actions outside licensed service tiers,
• physical effects beyond declared operational scope.
