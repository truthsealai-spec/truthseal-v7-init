## 1. SYSTEM CLASS SCOPE (WHAT IS GOVERNED)

This system class applies to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems capable of cross-domain reasoning, adaptive learning, autonomous planning, and goal-directed behaviour beyond bounded task definitions.

AGI systems governed under this class may interpret abstract objectives, generate novel strategies, modify internal decision pathways, and operate across multiple operational domains without fixed task constraints.

These systems may influence or determine outcomes with legal, financial, physical, societal, or strategic consequence.

This class includes any intelligence system whose behaviour cannot be fully predicted or constrained through static rules or narrow optimisation objectives.

AGI systems may operate continuously, self-adjust priorities, reconcile competing objectives, or coordinate complex actions over extended time horizons.

This class applies regardless of embodiment, deployment environment, or system architecture.

Systems capable of independent decision escalation, long-horizon optimisation, or autonomous adaptation fall under this class by default.

AGI systems embedded within larger platforms remain governed under this class if their outputs materially shape system behaviour.

This scope excludes bounded AI systems that lack generalisation capability.

## 2. GOVERNANCE OBJECTIVE

The objective of governance for AGI systems is to ensure that advanced intelligence remains subordinate to lawful human authority at all times.

AGI systems introduce qualitative risk due to their ability to generalise, adapt, and pursue objectives across domains without explicit human instruction at each step.

TruthSeal™ governance exists to prevent the emergence of unaccountable autonomy, decision opacity, or responsibility dilution.

The objective is to preserve human supremacy over goal-setting, escalation authority, and irreversible action execution.

Governance ensures that all AGI behaviour remains legible, auditable, attributable, and interruptible.

AGI governance focuses on authority control, not intelligence optimisation.

The goal is lawful operation under continuous oversight, not outcome prediction.

---

## 3. ACTIVE GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS

For AGI systems, TruthSeal™ activates continuous runtime governance systems.

Active systems include real-time behaviour monitoring, immutable decision recording, authority binding, and escalation threshold enforcement.

AGI outputs and internal state transitions are recorded as structured decision events suitable for audit and legal review.

Governance systems operate concurrently with AGI execution and do not rely solely on post-hoc reconstruction.

Human override pathways are continuously available and technically enforceable.

Decision provenance links AGI actions to authorised human command structures.

Governance systems ensure that no action chain proceeds without attributable authority.

---

## 4. ENFORCEMENT & ESCALATION MODEL

AGI systems governed under this class are subject to enforceable escalation controls.

TruthSeal™ governance enforces pre-execution legitimacy checks for actions exceeding defined impact thresholds.

Escalation routes include pause, review, override, or suspension mechanisms bound to authorised human roles.

AGI systems may be halted or constrained when governance conditions are breached.

Enforcement is deterministic, logged, and irreversible once triggered.

No AGI system may bypass governance enforcement under this class.

This model ensures that autonomy never exceeds declared authority.

---

## 5. ACCOUNTABILITY & RELIANCE

Reliance on TruthSeal™ governance for AGI systems means reliance on enforceable human accountability over advanced intelligence behaviour.

All AGI actions remain attributable to identifiable human authorities or institutions.

TruthSeal™ ensures that responsibility cannot be displaced onto the system itself.

AGI governance provides continuous evidence suitable for courts, regulators, insurers, and sovereign oversight bodies.

TruthSeal™ does not assume responsibility for strategic outcomes or policy decisions.

Reliance is limited to governance enforcement and accountability assurance.

This enables lawful deployment of AGI in high-impact environments.

---

## 6. EXCLUSIONS & NON-GUARANTEES

TruthSeal™ does not guarantee correctness, safety, or desirability of AGI decisions.

TruthSeal™ does not certify AGI alignment, ethics, or intent.

TruthSeal™ does not remove the need for human judgment, policy, or command responsibility.

Governance does not replace institutional governance, legal frameworks, or political authority.

AGI systems operating outside declared scope are not covered.

Misclassification voids governance reliance.
