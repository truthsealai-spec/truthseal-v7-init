1. PURPOSE OF SERVICE TIERS & BUNDLES

TruthSeal™ service tiers and bundles define how governance, audit, enforcement, and accountability systems are applied to Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems operating in real-world environments.

Not all intelligence systems carry equal consequence. An academic model, an enterprise decision engine, a judicial support system, and a military autonomous platform impose fundamentally different levels of risk, dependency, and public impact.

Service tiers exist to align governance depth with operational consequence. Each tier specifies which TruthSeal™ systems are active, what level of auditability is enforced, how accountability is maintained, and which authorities may rely on the outputs of the governed system.

TruthSeal™ does not license software features. It licenses enforceable governance coverage over AI, AGI, and robotic systems already deployed or under deployment by third parties.

Bundles combine governance systems into coherent coverage profiles, allowing institutions to select proportional oversight without ambiguity.

2. BASE TIER — FOUNDATIONAL AI GOVERNANCE

The Base Tier applies to Artificial Intelligence systems performing bounded, non-general cognitive functions with limited autonomy and clearly defined operational scope.

This tier governs AI systems used in analytics, decision support, forecasting, classification, optimisation, and recommendation contexts where outputs influence but do not independently execute irreversible actions.

Included governance systems focus on auditability, output traceability, and lawful operation. Base Tier enforces decision logging, provenance recording, and post-hoc accountability for AI outputs relied upon by human operators.

This tier is suitable for enterprises, universities, startups, and regulated organisations deploying AI systems that affect internal decisions, reporting, or advisory workflows.

The Base Tier does not permit autonomous execution, physical actuation, or self-directed goal formation. All responsibility remains explicitly human-bound.

This tier establishes governance clarity without imposing sovereign-level enforcement depth.

3. STANDARD TIER — ENTERPRISE & REGULATED SYSTEMS

The Standard Tier applies to AI systems whose outputs materially affect legal, financial, operational, or regulatory outcomes.

This tier governs AI systems used in finance, insurance, healthcare administration, logistics, infrastructure management, and regulated enterprise decision environments.

Standard Tier introduces continuous audit readiness, integrity verification, escalation visibility, and structured accountability mapping between system outputs and responsible human authorities.

Systems under this tier are expected to operate continuously and influence decisions with external consequence, requiring higher assurance than advisory AI alone.

TruthSeal™ governance systems at this tier ensure that AI outputs are provable, attributable, and defensible under regulatory or legal scrutiny.

Standard Tier remains human-directed but enforces stricter boundaries on output usage, escalation, and override mechanisms.

4. SUPREME TIER — AGI & HIGH-IMPACT AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS

The Supreme Tier applies to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems and advanced autonomous AI systems capable of multi-domain reasoning, adaptive strategy formation, and long-horizon decision processes.

This tier governs systems whose behaviour may influence or determine outcomes across legal, financial, societal, or strategic domains.

Supreme Tier enforces continuous governance visibility, pre-execution legitimacy controls, escalation thresholds, and immutable accountability records.

Systems under this tier are subject to enforced human supremacy, explicit override authority, and irreversible decision traceability.

This tier is suitable for sovereign institutions, national agencies, courts, large financial systems, and high-impact AGI deployments.

Supreme Tier establishes enforceable boundaries between cognition and action to prevent unaccountable autonomy.

5. ULTRA TIER — DEFENCE, MILITARY & SPACE SYSTEMS

The Ultra Tier applies to AI, AGI, and autonomous robotic systems operating in defence, military, space, or sovereign-critical environments.

This tier governs systems capable of physical actuation, strategic control, infrastructure manipulation, or national-level consequence.

Ultra Tier activates the full TruthSeal™ governance stack, including continuous enforcement, containment mechanisms, escalation authority, and sovereign accountability alignment.

Systems governed under this tier must operate under explicit legal authority and continuous human command responsibility.

Ultra Tier is designed for defence forces, space agencies, national security institutions, and sovereign infrastructure operators.

This tier represents the highest level of governance coverage available under TruthSeal™.

6. POST-QUANTUM & QUANTUM-RESILIENCE BUNDLE (ADD-ON)

The Post-Quantum bundle is an optional extension applicable to Standard, Supreme, or Ultra tiers.

This bundle introduces cryptographic resilience, integrity hardening, and coherence protection against post-quantum and quantum-enabled attack vectors.

It applies enhanced verification, cryptographic continuity, and advanced tamper resistance to governance, audit, and enforcement systems.

The Post-Quantum bundle is recommended for systems with long operational lifetimes, national security relevance, or exposure to advanced adversarial capabilities.

This bundle does not function independently and must be paired with an applicable service tier.

⸻

7. BUNDLE SELECTION & LICENSING PRINCIPLE

Service tiers and bundles are selected based on system class, operational consequence, and institutional responsibility.

TruthSeal™ works with clients to determine appropriate coverage but does not permit under-classification of systems.

Misclassification voids governance assurances and accountability guarantees.

Each licensed tier constitutes a legally meaningful governance commitment.
