**TS-AGI — ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM CLASS**

────────────────────────────────────────
**1. SYSTEM CLASS DEFINITION (WHAT IS GOVERNED)**

The TS-AGI System Class governs Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems that demonstrate cross-domain reasoning, adaptive learning, autonomous planning, and the capacity to generalise beyond bounded task definitions.

AGI systems governed under TS-AGI may interpret abstract objectives, generate novel strategies, modify internal decision pathways, and operate across multiple operational domains without fixed task constraints.

This system class applies to any intelligence system whose outputs, actions, or behavioural evolution may produce legal, financial, physical, societal, or geopolitical consequences.

────────────────────────────────────────
**2. GOVERNANCE THRESHOLD**

AGI systems represent a qualitative escalation of operational and societal risk relative to narrow or task-bounded AI systems.

Accordingly, no AGI system may operate under TruthSeal™ governance without continuous, active enforcement, audit, and accountability layers.

TS-AGI governance is mandatory for:
• cross-domain autonomous reasoning systems,
• self-directed planning or goal-optimising agents,
• systems capable of modifying strategies, policies, or objectives,
• AGI deployments relied upon by governments, courts, defence, finance, or critical infrastructure.

────────────────────────────────────────
**3. TRUTHSEAL™ GOVERNANCE GUARANTEES**

TruthSeal™ governance under the TS-AGI system class ensures that:

• All AGI actions, outputs, and decision pathways are traceable and auditable
• Decisions are attributable to identifiable and accountable human authority
• AGI behaviour remains bounded by declared legal, ethical, and operational constraints
• System drift, escalation, or goal divergence is detectable and provable
• No AGI action may proceed outside licensed scope without recorded human authorisation
• Responsibility cannot be displaced onto the system itself

AGI autonomy never supersedes human accountability.

────────────────────────────────────────
**4. MANDATORY SERVICE TIER ALIGNMENT**

TS-AGI systems require activation of Supreme or Ultra service tiers at all times.

Lower service tiers are invalid for AGI-class systems.

Supreme and Ultra tiers activate:
• continuous governance enforcement over reasoning and action pathways,
• multi-layer accountability binding,
• jurisdiction-aware audit mapping,
• override-protected human authority controls,
• cross-system liability attribution.

────────────────────────────────────────
**5. REGULATORY AND INSTITUTIONAL RELIANCE**

TS-AGI governance is designed for lawful reliance by:
• governments and national regulators,
• courts and judicial systems,
• defence, military, and space authorities,
• sovereign financial and infrastructure operators,
• cross-border and international institutions.

TruthSeal™ enables reliance on AGI systems by making responsibility provable, not by asserting system infallibility.

────────────────────────────────────────
**6. NON-DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY**

Under TS-AGI governance:
• AGI systems are not legal actors
• AGI systems cannot hold liability
• AGI systems cannot assume authority

Liability follows human authority, not intelligence capability.

────────────────────────────────────────
**7. SCOPE LIMITATION**

No governance, audit, enforcement, or accountability guarantee exists for:
• undeclared AGI capabilities,
• experimental or offline systems,
• deployments outside licensed service tiers,
• behaviours beyond declared operational scope.
