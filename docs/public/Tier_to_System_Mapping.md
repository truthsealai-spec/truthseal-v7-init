**TRUTHSEAL™ — TIER-TO-SYSTEM MAPPING
Public Canonical Document**

**1. PURPOSE OF TIER-TO-SYSTEM MAPPING**

This document defines how TruthSeal™ service tiers translate into concrete governance, audit, enforcement, and accountability systems applied to Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems.

Service tiers alone describe governance depth. Tier-to-system mapping specifies which TruthSeal™ systems are active, which controls are enforced, and what level of assurance is provided at each tier.

This mapping exists to remove ambiguity for governments, enterprises, regulators, courts, insurers, and institutional clients evaluating what they are licensing and what protections are in force.

Each tier activates a defined governance perimeter. Systems not explicitly included are not active, and guarantees do not extend beyond declared coverage.

This document is authoritative for understanding what each tier delivers in operational terms.

⸻

**2. BASE TIER — ACTIVE SYSTEMS**

The Base Tier activates foundational governance and audit systems for AI systems operating in bounded, non-general contexts.

Active systems include decision provenance logging, output traceability mechanisms, and audit-ready record generation for AI outputs relied upon by human decision-makers.

Base Tier enables post-hoc accountability by ensuring that AI outputs can be reconstructed, reviewed, and attributed to responsible operators or institutions.

No enforcement systems capable of intervention or execution control are active at this tier.

Base Tier does not include continuous runtime monitoring, escalation control, or autonomous containment.

This tier is appropriate where AI informs decisions but does not independently determine outcomes.

⸻

**3. STANDARD TIER — ACTIVE SYSTEMS**

The Standard Tier activates continuous governance systems for AI systems with material legal, financial, operational, or regulatory impact.

Active systems include continuous audit readiness, integrity verification, escalation signaling, and structured accountability mapping between AI outputs and human authorities.

Standard Tier enables near-real-time visibility into system behaviour without removing human operational control.

Governance systems at this tier ensure outputs remain provable, attributable, and defensible under regulatory or legal review.

Enforcement remains indirect; systems do not autonomously halt or intervene but generate enforceable evidence and alerts.

This tier supports regulated enterprise and institutional deployment environments.

⸻

**4. SUPREME TIER — ACTIVE SYSTEMS**

The Supreme Tier activates full governance and enforcement systems for AGI and advanced autonomous AI systems.

Active systems include continuous runtime governance, pre-execution legitimacy controls, escalation thresholds, immutable decision records, and human override enforcement.

Supreme Tier introduces enforceable boundaries between cognition and action to prevent unaccountable autonomy.

Systems under this tier operate with mandatory human supremacy, explicit authority mapping, and irreversible accountability records.

Governance at this tier applies to systems capable of long-horizon reasoning, adaptive strategy, and cross-domain influence.

This tier is designed for sovereign institutions, courts, national agencies, and high-impact AGI deployments.

⸻

**5. ULTRA TIER — ACTIVE SYSTEMS**

The Ultra Tier activates the complete TruthSeal™ governance, enforcement, and containment architecture.

Active systems include real-time enforcement, escalation authority, containment controls, sovereign accountability alignment, and irreversible audit continuity.

Ultra Tier applies to AI, AGI, and autonomous robotic systems capable of physical actuation, strategic control, or national-level consequence.

This tier enforces continuous lawful operation under explicit legal authority and human command responsibility.

Ultra Tier is intended for defence, military, space, and sovereign-critical infrastructure environments.

No system operating under this tier may function without active governance enforcement.

⸻

**6. POST-QUANTUM & QUANTUM-RESILIENCE ADD-ON**

The Post-Quantum bundle augments Standard, Supreme, or Ultra tiers with advanced cryptographic resilience and integrity hardening.

Active systems include enhanced verification, tamper resistance, cryptographic continuity, and protection against post-quantum and quantum-enabled attack vectors.

This bundle strengthens long-term assurance for systems with extended operational lifetimes or exposure to advanced adversarial capabilities.

The Post-Quantum bundle does not replace base governance; it extends assurance depth.

⸻

**7. SCOPE, LIMITATIONS, AND RELIANCE**

Tier-to-system mappings define the enforceable perimeter of TruthSeal™ coverage.

Guarantees apply only to systems and controls explicitly activated under the licensed tier and bundles.

Misclassification or undeclared system behaviour voids reliance claims.

This mapping is binding for licensing, enforcement, and accountability interpretation.
