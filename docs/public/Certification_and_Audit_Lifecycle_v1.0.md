**TRUTHSEAL™ — CERTIFICATION & AUDIT LIFECYCLE
Public Canonical Document**

## 1. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document defines the official TruthSeal™ certification and audit lifecycle for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems.

It establishes how systems enter governance, how certification is granted, how audit is continuously maintained, and how enforcement, escalation, suspension, or revocation occur.

The lifecycle exists to make advanced automated systems legally governable, institutionally reviewable, and operationally accountable over time.

This document is written for regulators, courts, insurers, governments, and enterprises that require certainty regarding governance status.

Certification under TruthSeal™ is not a one-time event but a continuous legal and operational condition.

This lifecycle removes ambiguity around responsibility, authority, and reliance.

---

## 2. CERTIFICATION PRINCIPLE

TruthSeal™ certification is a certification of governance enforceability, not of intelligence capability, performance quality, or outcome correctness.

Certification confirms that a system operates under active governance layers capable of producing verifiable evidence, enforceable accountability, and lawful oversight.

Certification does not imply that a system is error-free, ethical by intent, or immune to misuse.

Instead, it guarantees that misuse, failure, or harm cannot occur without traceability, attribution, and legal responsibility.

Certification binds authority to liability in a non-transferable manner.

This principle applies uniformly across AI, AGI, robotic, infrastructure, and defence system classes.

---

## 3. CERTIFICATION ENTRY CONDITIONS

Before certification, the system owner or operator must formally declare the system class, service tier, operational scope, deployment context, and responsible human authorities.

Declarations must include the type of intelligence system, domains of operation, autonomy level, and potential real-world impact.

TruthSeal™ relies on these declarations to activate appropriate governance layers.

False, incomplete, or misleading declarations invalidate certification eligibility.

Entry conditions exist to ensure proportional governance relative to operational risk.

Certification cannot be granted to undeclared, opaque, or dynamically concealed systems.

---

## 4. INITIAL GOVERNANCE ACTIVATION

Upon acceptance, TruthSeal™ activates governance systems corresponding to the licensed service tier and declared system class.

Activation includes audit record generation, accountability binding, authority mapping, and evidence continuity mechanisms.

Where applicable, enforcement gates and escalation thresholds are enabled.

Activation is time-stamped, logged, and cryptographically bound to the system identity.

From this point forward, the system is considered governed, not autonomous.

Governance activation is a legally meaningful transition state.

---

## 5. CONTINUOUS AUDIT OPERATION

Certified systems operate under continuous audit conditions for the duration of certification.

Audit records capture decisions, actions, authority context, and system state transitions relevant to accountability.

Audit is designed to support post-incident reconstruction, regulatory review, and judicial examination.

Audit systems do not interfere with system performance unless enforcement is explicitly enabled.

Continuity of audit is mandatory; gaps invalidate certification status.

Audit depth scales with service tier and system class.

---

## 6. ENFORCEMENT & ESCALATION MECHANISMS

Where enabled, TruthSeal™ governance enforces boundaries between cognition and action.

Enforcement mechanisms may block, pause, or escalate system actions that exceed declared authority or lawful scope.

Escalation routes decisions to designated human authorities.

Overrides are permitted only with explicit authorisation and are permanently recorded.

Enforcement ensures that no irreversible action occurs without accountable human authority.

This section applies most strongly to Supreme and Ultra tiers.

---

## 7. PERIODIC REVIEW & RECERTIFICATION

Certified systems are subject to periodic review based on tier, risk profile, and operational domain.

Reviews assess compliance with declared scope, integrity of governance layers, and adequacy of accountability records.

Reviews may result in continuation, modification, tier adjustment, or suspension.

Recertification is not automatic and may require remediation.

Review frequency increases with operational risk and autonomy.

---

## 8. INCIDENT HANDLING & INVESTIGATION

When incidents occur, TruthSeal™ governance ensures evidence availability rather than outcome prevention guarantees.

Audit records enable reconstruction of events, decisions, and authority chains.

Investigations may be conducted by regulators, courts, insurers, or authorised institutions.

TruthSeal™ does not adjudicate outcomes but enables lawful adjudication.

This capability is central to public trust and institutional reliance.

---

## 9. SUSPENSION & REVOCATION

Certification may be suspended or revoked when governance layers are bypassed, disabled, or misrepresented.

Revocation occurs when continued operation poses unacceptable legal or societal risk.

Suspension may be temporary pending remediation.

All suspension and revocation events are logged and auditable.

A revoked system may not claim TruthSeal™ governance status.

---

## 10. ROLE OF REGULATORS, COURTS, AND INSTITUTIONS

TruthSeal™ provides the technical substrate that allows institutions to rely on governed systems without assuming control.

Regulators may inspect certification status and audit integrity.

Courts may rely on governance records for liability determination.

Insurers may assess risk based on certified governance scope.

TruthSeal™ enables oversight without centralising power.

---

## 11. PUBLIC INTERPRETATION RULE

This document is the authoritative public reference for TruthSeal™ certification and audit lifecycle interpretation.

In case of conflict, this document supersedes marketing, presentations, or informal descriptions.

Interpretation must align with declared system classes, licensed service tiers, and active governance layers.

No implied guarantees exist beyond declared scope.
