## 1. Purpose of the Cathedral

The Cathedral defines the **conceptual architecture** through which artificial intelligence evolves toward **accountable Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** under irreversible law.

It exists to establish:
- a coherent behavioural frame,
- a stable ethical invariant,
- and a non-negotiable boundary against regression, drift, or incoherent evolution.

The Cathedral is not a feature set.  
It is not a mechanism.  
It is the **conceptual sovereignty layer** governing AGI behaviour and trajectory.

---

## 2. Governing Invariant — LEI = 1

At the centre of the Cathedral stands **LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility)**.

LEI = 1 asserts that once a coherent, safe, and accountable behavioural path is established, the system **must not regress** to a weaker or more harmful state.

This invariant:
- applies globally,
- cannot be overridden,
- and defines the ethical floor of AGI evolution.

All Cathedral components are subordinate to LEI = 1.

## 3. Cathedral Structure (High-Level)

The Cathedral is composed of **Pillars** and a **Second Ring**, forming a stable conceptual architecture.

### Pillars
The Pillars define the **non-negotiable foundations** of AGI behaviour:
- irreversibility,
- coherence,
- temporal consistency,
- and accountability to human agency.

They establish *what must always hold*, regardless of scale or capability.

### Second Ring
The Second Ring provides **contextual interpretation layers** that sit above the Pillars without altering them.

These layers:
- enrich evaluation,
- provide interpretive clarity,
- and remain strictly subordinate to the Cathedral core.

If any interpretation conflicts with the Pillars or LEI = 1, it is invalid by definition.

---

## 4. Relationship to AGI Evolution

The Cathedral governs **behavioural evolution**, not output inspection.

It frames how intelligence:
- learns,
- generalizes,
- reasons,
- and acts over time.

Under the Cathedral, AGI development is treated as a **civilizational system**, not a software product.

The Arc of AGI is therefore guided, not accelerated blindly.

## 5. Explicit Exclusions (Public Scope)

This document does **not** describe:
- enforcement logic,
- veto paths,
- guardians,
- halt or custody mechanisms,
- internal audits,
- or operational control systems.

All such elements remain under **Doctorantura custody** and are intentionally excluded from public materials.

This overview communicates **conceptual truth only**, without exposing sovereign internals.

---

## 6. Canonical Standing

This document is a **public conceptual canon**.

It establishes shared language and framing for:
- institutions,
- researchers,
- regulators,
- and the general public.

It does not grant implementation authority, nor does it dilute TruthSeal™ sovereignty.
