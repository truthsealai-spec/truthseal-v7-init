# TRUTHSEAL™ — SYSTEM CLASSES OVERVIEW

## PREAMBLE — PURPOSE OF SYSTEM CLASSES

This document defines the public system classes under which TruthSeal™ governance, audit, enforcement, and accountability systems are licensed and deployed.

System classes exist to clearly specify:
- What type of AI, AGI, or robotic system is being governed  
- What level of operational risk is present  
- What TruthSeal™ governance layers are required  
- What institutions, organisations, or authorities may rely on the system  

System classes are not product descriptions.  
They are governance categories used to determine licensing scope, enforcement depth, and accountability requirements.

## TS-AI — ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM CLASS

TS-AI applies to Artificial Intelligence systems that perform bounded, non-general cognitive functions while operating in live, production, or decision-support environments.

These systems include predictive models, optimisation engines, scoring systems, classifiers, recommender systems, and automated decision pipelines that influence legal, financial, operational, or societal outcomes.

TruthSeal™ governance under TS-AI ensures that:
- Outputs are traceable and auditable  
- Decisions are attributable to accountable human authority  
- Behaviour remains within declared operational scope  
- System misuse or drift is detectable and provable  

TS-AI is suitable for enterprises, institutions, regulators, and courts that rely on AI-assisted decisions but do not deploy general intelligence.

## TS-AGI — ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM CLASS

TS-AGI applies to Artificial General Intelligence systems capable of continuous operation, cross-domain reasoning, goal formation, and adaptive strategy over extended time horizons.

These systems are not task-limited tools. They are persistent reasoning entities whose outputs may influence or determine consequential outcomes across multiple domains.

TruthSeal™ governance under TS-AGI ensures that:
- All actions remain bound to lawful authority  
- No irreversible action occurs without provable authorisation  
- Continuous auditability is enforced across time  
- Human accountability cannot be bypassed by autonomy  

TS-AGI licensing is intended for governments, sovereign institutions, advanced research bodies, and high-impact enterprise deployments.

## TS-R — ROBOTIC & CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEM CLASS

TS-R applies to robotic and cyber-physical systems capable of executing physical actions in the real world.

This includes systems with sensors, actuators, motors, control loops, or autonomous execution pathways that translate digital decisions into physical outcomes affecting people, property, or environments.

TruthSeal™ governance under TS-R ensures that:
- Physical actions are legally attributable  
- Actuation events are fully auditable  
- Escalation and intervention pathways exist  
- Irreversible harm cannot occur without human accountability  

TS-R licensing may apply to single robots (TS-R1), coordinated fleets or swarms (TS-R2), or autonomous infrastructure-embedded robotics (TS-R3).

## TS-INFRA — CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM CLASS

TS-INFRA applies to AI, AGI, or automated control systems that manage, influence, or constrain critical infrastructure.

This includes systems used in energy, water, transport, telecommunications, healthcare, financial clearing, supply chains, and essential public services.

TruthSeal™ governance under TS-INFRA ensures that:
- Infrastructure control actions are provable and lawful  
- System failures are traceable and accountable  
- Governance bypass is detectable in real time  
- Cascading risk is constrained by enforceable limits  

TS-INFRA licensing is intended for governments, operators, insurers, and infrastructure authorities.

## TS-DEF — DEFENCE, MILITARY & SPACE SYSTEM CLASS

TS-DEF applies to AI, AGI, and robotic systems used in defence, military, intelligence, aerospace, and space operations.

These systems may operate under extreme conditions, high autonomy, or strategic sensitivity, but remain subject to human authority and lawful governance.

TruthSeal™ governance under TS-DEF ensures that:
- Command authority is explicit and provable  
- Escalation thresholds are enforced  
- Actions remain attributable despite autonomy  
- Post-event auditability is preserved  

TS-DEF licensing is restricted and provided only under explicit institutional agreement.

## LICENSING NOTE

Each system class may be licensed under different service tiers, depending on:
- Operational risk  
- Required governance depth  
- Enforcement strictness  
- Audit and accountability needs  

Not all clients require all system classes.  
TruthSeal™ licensing is structured to match real-world use, not theoretical capability.

---

## PUBLIC ASSURANCE

TruthSeal™ system classes exist to ensure that no AI, AGI, or autonomous system operates without lawful governance, continuous auditability, and human accountability.

System capability does not grant authority.  
Authority must be governed, enforced, and provable.
