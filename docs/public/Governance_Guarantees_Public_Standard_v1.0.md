**TRUTHSEAL™ — PUBLIC GOVERNANCE STANDARD  
Governance Guarantees Mapped to Service Tiers & System Classes  
Version: 1.0** 
**Status: Public Canonical Reference**

────────────────────────────────

**PREAMBLE — PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY**

This document defines the binding public governance guarantees provided by TruthSeal™
when its systems are licensed, deployed, and actively enforced.

TruthSeal™ is a private organisation that provides governance, audit, enforcement,
and accountability systems for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems.

TruthSeal™ does not develop AI models, does not generate intelligence outputs,
and does not replace human authority. Its function is to ensure that intelligence
systems created and operated by others remain lawful, coherent, provable,
attack-resilient, and human-accountable at all times.

The guarantees defined in this document apply only within explicitly licensed
service tiers and declared system classes. They exist to give governments,
regulators, courts, insurers, enterprises, and infrastructure operators
absolute clarity about what is covered, how it is enforced, and where
responsibility resides.

────────────────────────────────

**1. CORE GOVERNANCE GUARANTEES (WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ DELIVERS)**

When TruthSeal™ governance is active, the following guarantees apply:

• All governed AI, AGI, and robotic system actions are auditable and traceable  
• Human authority over consequential decisions is preserved and enforceable  
• Accountability for system behaviour is provable and non-deniable  
• Unlawful or incoherent actions are detectable and preventable within scope  
• All governance events are cryptographically recorded and verifiable  
• System behaviour can be examined post-incident with evidentiary integrity  

These guarantees do not rely on trust, intent, or model quality.
They rely on enforced governance systems operating continuously.

TruthSeal™ exists to make reliance on AI and AGI lawful and defensible,
not speculative or informal.

────────────────────────────────

**2. HUMAN ACCOUNTABILITY GUARANTEE**

TruthSeal™ guarantees that responsibility for AI and AGI behaviour
remains attributable to identifiable human and institutional authorities.

No governed system may obscure, displace, or dissolve responsibility
through automation, scale, or complexity.

Human accountability is preserved regardless of:
• System autonomy
• Operational speed
• Deployment scale
• Model architecture
• Jurisdictional distribution

TruthSeal™ governance ensures that authority follows decision power,
and that responsibility can be demonstrated to regulators, courts,
and oversight bodies when required.

────────────────────────────────

**3. AUDIT AND TRACEABILITY GUARANTEE**

TruthSeal™ guarantees continuous auditability of governed systems.

This includes:
• Deterministic logging of governed actions
• Cryptographic integrity of records
• Temporal ordering of decisions and interventions
• Preservation of evidence across system lifecycles

Audit records produced under TruthSeal™ governance are designed to be:
• Court-admissible
• Regulator-reviewable
• Insurer-verifiable
• Forensically reconstructable

Auditability is active, not retrospective.

────────────────────────────────

**4. ENFORCEMENT GUARANTEE**

TruthSeal™ guarantees that governance rules are enforceable, not advisory.

Within licensed scope:
• Governance rules constrain system behaviour
• Escalation pathways are enforced
• Human override is technically supported
• Violations are detectable and recorded

TruthSeal™ governance operates as a control and enforcement layer,
not as a reporting overlay.

────────────────────────────────

**5. SERVICE TIERS — GOVERNANCE DEPTH DEFINITION**

Service tiers define the depth, intensity, and continuity of governance coverage.
They do not change what TruthSeal™ is.
They define how much of its governance stack is active.

Service tiers are cumulative.

────────────────────────────────

**6. BASE TIER — FOUNDATIONAL GOVERNANCE**

The Base tier provides foundational governance coverage for AI systems
with limited operational consequence.

Includes:
• Identity binding
• Action traceability
• Audit record generation
• Basic accountability preservation

Suitable for:
• Research deployments
• Internal decision-support
• Non-critical AI systems

────────────────────────────────

**7. STANDARD TIER — CONTINUOUS OPERATIONAL GOVERNANCE**

The Standard tier adds continuous governance enforcement for production AI systems.

Includes:
• Continuous audit coverage
• Escalation pathways
• Human accountability enforcement
• Operational integrity verification

Suitable for:
• Enterprise AI
• Regulated business systems
• Judicial and administrative tooling

────────────────────────────────

**8. SUPREME TIER — SOVEREIGN-GRADE GOVERNANCE**

The Supreme tier provides sovereign-grade governance depth.

Includes:
• Multi-layer enforcement
• Cross-actor accountability binding
• Jurisdiction-aware audit mapping
• Continuous lawful-operation assurance

Required for:
• AGI-class systems
• National financial systems
• Courts and regulators
• High-impact decision engines

────────────────────────────────

**9. ULTRA TIER — MAXIMUM GOVERNANCE DEPTH**

The Ultra tier represents the highest level of governance coverage
available under TruthSeal™.

Includes:
• Full enforcement stack activation
• Continuous coherence verification
• Multi-authority accountability binding
• Resilience against advanced adversarial manipulation
• Long-horizon audit survivability

Ultra governance is designed for systems whose failure,
misuse, or compromise would cause severe societal,
legal, or national consequence.

────────────────────────────────

**10. POST-QUANTUM EXTENSION — CRYPTOGRAPHIC RESILIENCE**

The Post-Quantum extension strengthens governance integrity
against quantum and post-quantum attack vectors.

Includes:
• Post-quantum receipts
• Forward-secure audit continuity
• Cryptographic agility
• Long-term verifiability

Mandatory for:
• Defence systems
• Sovereign records
• Long-lived AGI deployments
• Space and national security systems

────────────────────────────────

**11. SYSTEM CLASS — SERVICE TIER REQUIREMENTS**

System classes define what type of AI, AGI, or robotic system is governed.
They do not redefine governance guarantees.
They specify minimum required service tiers.

────────────────────────────────

**11.1 TS-AI — Artificial Intelligence Systems
Minimum Tier: Standard**

**11.2 TS-AGI — Artificial General Intelligence Systems  
Minimum Tier: Supreme** 

**11.3 TS-R — Autonomous Robotic Systems  
Minimum Tier: Supreme**  

**11.4 TS-INFRA — Critical Infrastructure Systems  
Minimum Tier: Supreme** 

**11.5 TS-DEF — Defence, Military & Space Systems  
Required Tier: Ultra + Post-Quantum Extension** 

**Lower tiers are invalid for TS-DEF systems**

────────────────────────────────

**12. SCOPE AND LIMITATION CLARITY**

TruthSeal™ guarantees apply strictly within:
• Declared system classes
• Licensed service tiers
• Active governance deployment

No implied coverage exists outside declared scope.
No informal or partial deployment may claim TruthSeal™ governance.

This clarity is intentional.
It protects clients, regulators, and the public.

────────────────────────────────

**FINAL AUTHORITY**

This document is the authoritative public reference for
TruthSeal™ governance guarantees.

In case of conflict, this document supersedes
presentations, summaries, or informal descriptions.
