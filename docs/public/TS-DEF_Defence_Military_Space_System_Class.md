TS-DEF — DEFENCE, MILITARY & SPACE SYSTEM CLASS

────────────────────────────────────────
**1. SYSTEM CLASS DEFINITION (WHAT IS GOVERNED)**

The TS-DEF System Class governs Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), autonomous, cyber-physical, and decision systems deployed within defence, military, national security, intelligence, and space-based environments.

These systems operate in contexts where failure, misuse, or loss of control may result in loss of life, armed conflict escalation, irreversible geopolitical consequences, or catastrophic national or global harm.

TS-DEF applies to systems used for command, control, intelligence analysis, targeting support, strategic planning, autonomous operation, space assets, and defence infrastructure coordination.

────────────────────────────────────────
**2. GOVERNANCE THRESHOLD**

TS-DEF systems operate at the highest possible risk tier.

Any system whose outputs, recommendations, or actions may influence:
• military force,
• strategic defence posture,
• weapons systems,
• intelligence operations,
• space-based assets,
• or national security decisions

must operate under continuous, enforceable TruthSeal™ governance.

────────────────────────────────────────
**3. MANDATORY SERVICE TIER REQUIREMENT**

TS-DEF deployments are restricted to:

• Supreme Tier
• Ultra Tier
• Ultra Tier with Post-Quantum Extension (mandatory for long-lived or strategic systems)

No Base or Standard tier coverage is permitted for TS-DEF systems.

Service tier selection determines enforcement depth, audit continuity, cryptographic resilience, and liability binding.

────────────────────────────────────────
**4. TRUTHSEAL™ GOVERNANCE GUARANTEES**

TruthSeal™ governance under TS-DEF ensures that:

• All system outputs are attributable to authorised human command
• All decisions are continuously auditable and forensically reconstructable
• All action pathways remain interruptible by lawful authority
• Misuse, manipulation, or deviation is detectable and provable
• Responsibility and liability cannot be displaced onto automation
• No autonomous system may assume sovereign authority

TruthSeal™ governs control, not intent; authority remains human.

────────────────────────────────────────
**5. INTERACTION WITH AI, AGI, AND ROBOTIC SYSTEMS**

TS-DEF systems frequently integrate:

• TS-AI for bounded intelligence functions
• TS-AGI for cross-domain reasoning systems
• TS-R for physical or kinetic execution layers
• TS-INFRA for defence infrastructure dependencies

All layers must be jointly governed with unified accountability chains. Fragmented governance is prohibited.

────────────────────────────────────────
**6. POST-QUANTUM AND ADVERSARIAL RESILIENCE**

TS-DEF systems require cryptographic resilience against:
• state-level adversaries,
• quantum and post-quantum attack vectors,
• long-horizon data compromise,
• and strategic tampering.

Post-Quantum governance extensions are mandatory for:
• weapons systems,
• intelligence archives,
• space assets,
• sovereign records,
• and systems requiring decades-long verifiability.

────────────────────────────────────────
**7. REGULATORY AND SOVEREIGN RELIANCE**

TS-DEF governance enables lawful reliance by:
• defence ministries,
• military commands,
• intelligence agencies,
• national security regulators,
• allied governments,
• and international oversight bodies.

Reliance is based on provable accountability and enforceable governance, not system infallibility.

────────────────────────────────────────
**8. NON-DELEGATION OF SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY**

Under TS-DEF governance:
• Machines are not legal actors
• Autonomy does not confer authority
• Responsibility cannot be automated
• Liability follows command and jurisdiction

No delegation of sovereign power to machines is permitted.

────────────────────────────────────────
**9. SCOPE LIMITATION**

No governance, audit, enforcement, or accountability guarantee exists for:
• undeclared systems or subsystems,
• experimental or research deployments,
• actions outside licensed service tiers,
• effects beyond declared operational scope.
