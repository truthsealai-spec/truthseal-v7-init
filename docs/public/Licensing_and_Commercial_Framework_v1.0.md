## 1. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document defines the commercial and licensing structure through which TruthSeal™ governance services are provided.

It exists to give buyers, regulators, insurers, and institutional stakeholders clear certainty regarding what is licensed, how pricing scales, and why governance depth increases with system risk.

This document does not describe product features or operational outcomes.

It defines the legal and governance scope of TruthSeal™ services.

---

## 2. WHAT IS LICENSED

TruthSeal™ licenses governance capability.

This includes governance classification, audit continuity, accountability binding, enforcement availability, and evidentiary record generation.

TruthSeal™ does not license AI models, algorithms, datasets, training pipelines, or execution systems.

The license grants the right to apply TruthSeal™ governance layers to external systems owned or operated by the licensee.

---

## 3. TIER-BASED LICENSING MODEL

TruthSeal™ licensing is tier-based to align governance depth with system risk.

Lower tiers provide foundational governance visibility and auditability.

Higher tiers activate additional enforcement, escalation, and control-plane authority.

Each tier explicitly defines which governance systems are active and which are excluded.

Using a lower tier for a higher-risk system constitutes misclassification and voids reliance.

---

## 4. WHY PRICE SCALES WITH RISK

Governance cost scales with risk because higher-risk systems require:

• deeper audit continuity  
• stronger accountability binding  
• higher enforcement readiness  
• greater legal exposure  
• more stringent review obligations  

TruthSeal™ pricing reflects governance burden, not compute, usage, or transaction volume.

High-impact systems cannot be governed at low-risk prices.

---

## 5. NO FEATURE COMPARISON SALES

TruthSeal™ tiers are not feature bundles.

They represent legally distinct governance states.

A higher tier does not simply include “more features” — it enables governance actions that lower tiers are explicitly prohibited from performing.

Buyers select governance posture, not software capability.

---

## 6. LICENSING OBLIGATIONS

Licensees are responsible for accurate system classification.

Changes in system capability, autonomy, or deployment context must be declared.

TruthSeal™ reserves the right to require tier upgrades when system risk increases.

Failure to comply may result in suspension or revocation.

---

## 7. COMMERCIAL CERTAINTY

This framework ensures buyers understand:

• what protections they receive  
• what responsibilities they retain  
• what governance is enforceable  
• what is excluded  

This clarity protects both the licensee and TruthSeal™.
