## What is TruthSeal™?

TruthSeal™ is a sovereign governance framework that defines how artificial intelligence
evolves toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) under irreversible law.

It focuses on **behaviour**, not just capability.

---

## Why does TruthSeal™ exist?

As AI systems scale, performance can improve while coherence degrades.
TruthSeal™ exists to ensure that progress does not outpace responsibility.

It establishes a lawful arc where intelligence growth remains accountable.

---

## What does “Sovereign Arc of AGI” mean?

It means AGI is treated as a **behavioural evolution constrained by law**,
not a sudden capability milestone.

Intelligence is recognised only when it remains coherent as it generalises.

---

## What is LEI = 1?

LEI = 1 is the Law of Ethical Irreversibility.

Once a safer and more coherent path is known,
regression to weaker or riskier behaviour is not permitted.

This invariant governs all TruthSeal™ doctrine.

---

## Is TruthSeal™ a model or a chatbot?

No.

TruthSeal™ is not a model, not a chatbot, and not a single system.
It is a governance framework that can apply across systems and institutions.

---

## Does TruthSeal™ replace existing laws or ethics boards?

No.

TruthSeal™ complements legal, regulatory, and human decision-making.
It does not replace courts, regulators, or professional authority.

---

## Who is TruthSeal™ for?

TruthSeal™ is designed for:
- researchers and engineers,
- regulators and policy makers,
- academic institutions,
- infrastructure and system architects,
- organisations concerned with long-horizon AI governance.

---

## Does this document describe how TruthSeal™ is enforced?

No.

Public documents explain **principles and intent only**.
All enforcement, custody, and operational logic is held separately.

---

## How should this FAQ be used?

This FAQ is a shared reference for public understanding.
It is intended to prevent misinterpretation and establish a common baseline.
