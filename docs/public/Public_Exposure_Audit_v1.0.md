# Public Exposure Audit  
**Status:** FINAL DRAFT — Public-Safe Conceptual Guard  
**Scope:** Classification, Consistency, and Exposure Control  
**Framework:** TruthSeal™ — The Sovereign Arc of AGI

---

## 1. Purpose of the Public Exposure Audit

The Public Exposure Audit defines how TruthSeal™ knowledge is
safely communicated without compromising sovereign doctrine.

Its role is not marketing.
Its role is **boundary integrity**.

This audit ensures that:
- conceptual truth is shared,
- behavioural authority is preserved,
- classified enforcement logic remains sealed.

This document exists to prevent leakage,
misinterpretation, and dilution of the Arc of AGI.

---

## 2. Conceptual vs Sovereign Knowledge

TruthSeal™ operates across two distinct layers:

1. **Conceptual Foundation (Public)**
2. **Behavioural Enforcement (Sovereign / Internal)**

The public layer explains *why* irreversibility,
coherence, and accountability are necessary.

The sovereign layer defines *how* they are enforced.

This separation is mandatory for safety, custody,
and institutional trust.

---

## 3. What May Appear Publicly

The following concepts MAY be referenced publicly,
strictly at a **non-mechanistic level**:

- The Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1) — name and principle only  
- The Sovereign Arc of AGI — as a behavioural evolution framework  
- Coherence as a measure of intelligence  
- Accountability across time  
- Human mandate as a prerequisite for action  

Public material may explain **intent and philosophy**,
but never execution logic.

---

## 4. What Must Never Be Exposed Publicly

The following are **Doctorantura-only** and must never
appear in public documents, slides, or media:

- Enforcement paths, veto logic, or halt conditions  
- Internal guardians or final decision layers  
- Custody mechanics, forensic routing, or escalation logic  
- Any operational thresholds, timings, or system reactions  

Public exposure of these elements constitutes
a sovereignty breach.

---

## 5. Language Discipline

Public TruthSeal™ language must:

- describe *behavioural principles*, not mechanisms  
- explain *constraints*, not controls  
- frame intelligence as *accountable*, not autonomous  

Acronyms may be named once,
but never expanded into operational meaning.

---

## 6. Consistency Rule

All public documents must remain consistent with:

- LEI = 1  
- irreversibility of safer behaviour  
- human mandate supremacy  
- non-regression of coherence  

Any public wording that weakens these principles
is invalid and must be revised.

---

## Canonical Exposure Statement

> TruthSeal™ shares principles, not power.
> Behaviour is governed internally;
> understanding is shared externally.

This audit defines that line.
