# TRUTHSEAL™ — PUBLIC CANONICAL OVERVIEW

Status: Public Canonical Reference  
Version: 1.0  
Date: 2025-12-25  

---

## 1. WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ IS

TruthSeal™ is an independent governance organisation that provides **governance, audit, enforcement, and accountability systems** for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems.

TruthSeal™ does **not** develop AI models, does **not** operate AI services, and does **not** generate intelligence outputs.

TruthSeal™ governs the **conditions under which intelligence systems are permitted to operate**, ensuring that their actions, outputs, and operational behaviour remain:
- lawful,
- provable,
- traceable,
- and human-accountable at all times.

TruthSeal™ exists to make advanced automated systems governable under human authority, legal frameworks, and verifiable operational standards.

---

## 2. WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ IS NOT

TruthSeal™ is **not**:
- an AI developer,
- a model provider,
- a prediction engine,
- an ethical intent certifier,
- or a guarantor of outcome quality.

TruthSeal™ does **not** claim that governed systems are correct, beneficial, safe, or desirable in outcome.

TruthSeal™ does **not** replace human decision-making, legal responsibility, or institutional authority.

---

## 3. WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ PROVIDES

TruthSeal™ provides governance guarantees for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems — not guarantees of intelligence quality or outcome correctness.

These governance guarantees apply to the behaviour, actions, outputs, and operational conditions of AI, AGI, and autonomous systems deployed in real-world environments.

They include:
- enforceable accountability attribution for AI- and AGI-driven actions,
- verifiable auditability of automated decisions and system behaviour,
- traceable chains of responsibility linking system outputs to human authority,
- irreversible linkage between operational authority and legal liability,
- and governance enforcement proportional to operational risk and system class.

TruthSeal™ ensures that responsibility for AI, AGI, and autonomous systems cannot be denied, obscured, or displaced by automation.

---

## 4. GOVERNANCE GUARANTEES (HIGH-LEVEL)

Within explicitly licensed scope, TruthSeal™ governance guarantees that:

- all governed systems operate under declared authority,
- accountability remains human and legally attributable,
- actions and outputs are auditable and reconstructable,
- unlawful or incoherent actions cannot proceed without authorised override,
- and governance integrity remains verifiable over time.

No guarantee exists outside declared system classes and activated service tiers.

---

## 5. SYSTEM CLASSES

TruthSeal™ governance applies only to explicitly declared **system classes**, including but not limited to:
- AI systems,
- AGI-class systems,
- autonomous robotic systems,
- critical infrastructure systems,
- defence and national security systems (TS-DEF).

System classes define **what type of system is governed**, not how deeply it is governed.

---

## 6. SERVICE TIERS

TruthSeal™ service tiers define **governance depth**, including:
- audit coverage,
- enforcement strength,
- accountability binding,
- and verification continuity.

Service tiers do not describe products or features.
They define **governance capability and enforcement scope**.

---

## 7. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLASSES AND TIERS

System classes define **what** is governed.  
Service tiers define **how deeply** it is governed.

Governance guarantees apply **only when both**:
- a system class is declared, and
- a service tier is actively licensed.

---

## 8. RELIANCE AND LIABILITY PRINCIPLE

Reliance on TruthSeal™ governance means lawful reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems through **provable accountability**, not reliance on system infallibility.

TruthSeal™ governance enables institutions, regulators, courts, and operators to rely on AI, AGI, and autonomous systems only insofar as their actions, outputs, and operational behaviour remain traceable, auditable, and attributable to human authority.

All responsibility for AI and AGI system design, objectives, training data, deployment decisions, operational constraints, and real-world use cases remains with the system owners and operators.

TruthSeal™ governance ensures that responsibility for AI-, AGI-, and autonomous-system actions follows authority and **cannot be displaced onto machines, automation, or model behaviour**.

---

## 9. PUBLIC INTERPRETATION RULE

This document is the authoritative public reference for interpreting the scope, role, and limits of TruthSeal™ governance services as they apply to Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems.

In the event of any conflict, this document supersedes all:
- marketing materials,
- presentations,
- informal explanations,
- derivative summaries,
- or third-party interpretations.

All interpretations of TruthSeal™ governance must align strictly with:
- the declared AI, AGI, and robotic system classes under governance, and
- the licensed service tiers defining which governance, audit, enforcement, and accountability systems are active.

No interpretation may extend TruthSeal™ governance beyond its explicitly declared system classes or licensed service tiers.
