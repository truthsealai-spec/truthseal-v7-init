# TRUTHSEAL™ — PUBLIC CANONICAL OVERVIEW

Status: Public Canonical Reference  
Version: 1.0  
Date: 2025-12-25  

---

## 1. WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ IS

TruthSeal™ is an independent governance organisation that provides **governance, audit, enforcement, and accountability systems** for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems.

TruthSeal™ does **not** develop AI models, does **not** operate AI services, and does **not** generate intelligence outputs.

TruthSeal™ governs the **conditions under which intelligence systems are permitted to operate**, ensuring that their actions, outputs, and operational behaviour remain:
- lawful,
- provable,
- traceable,
- and human-accountable at all times.

TruthSeal™ exists to make advanced automated systems governable under human authority, legal frameworks, and verifiable operational standards.

---

## 2. WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ IS NOT

TruthSeal™ is **not**:
- an AI developer,
- a model provider,
- a prediction engine,
- an ethical intent certifier,
- or a guarantor of outcome quality.

TruthSeal™ does **not** claim that governed systems are correct, beneficial, safe, or desirable in outcome.

TruthSeal™ does **not** replace human decision-making, legal responsibility, or institutional authority.

---

## 3. WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ PROVIDES

TruthSeal™ provides **governance guarantees**, not outcome guarantees.

These guarantees include:
- enforceable accountability attribution,
- verifiable auditability of actions and decisions,
- traceable responsibility chains,
- irreversible linkage between authority and liability,
- and governance enforcement proportional to operational risk.

TruthSeal™ ensures that **responsibility cannot be denied, obscured, or displaced by automation**.

---

## 4. GOVERNANCE GUARANTEES (HIGH-LEVEL)

Within explicitly licensed scope, TruthSeal™ governance guarantees that:

- all governed systems operate under declared authority,
- accountability remains human and legally attributable,
- actions and outputs are auditable and reconstructable,
- unlawful or incoherent actions cannot proceed without authorised override,
- and governance integrity remains verifiable over time.

No guarantee exists outside declared system classes and activated service tiers.

---

## 5. SYSTEM CLASSES

TruthSeal™ governance applies only to explicitly declared **system classes**, including but not limited to:
- AI systems,
- AGI-class systems,
- autonomous robotic systems,
- critical infrastructure systems,
- defence and national security systems (TS-DEF).

System classes define **what type of system is governed**, not how deeply it is governed.

---

## 6. SERVICE TIERS

TruthSeal™ service tiers define **governance depth**, including:
- audit coverage,
- enforcement strength,
- accountability binding,
- and verification continuity.

Service tiers do not describe products or features.
They define **governance capability and enforcement scope**.

---

## 7. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLASSES AND TIERS

System classes define **what** is governed.  
Service tiers define **how deeply** it is governed.

Governance guarantees apply **only when both**:
- a system class is declared, and
- a service tier is actively licensed.

---

## 8. RELIANCE AND LIABILITY PRINCIPLE

Reliance on TruthSeal™ governance means reliance on **provable accountability**, not system infallibility.

All responsibility for system design, objectives, training data, deployment decisions, and use cases remains with system owners and operators.

TruthSeal™ governance ensures that responsibility follows authority and **cannot be displaced onto machines**.

---

## 9. PUBLIC INTERPRETATION RULE

This document is the authoritative public reference for interpreting TruthSeal™ scope and role.

In case of conflict, this document supersedes:
- marketing materials,
- presentations,
- informal explanations,
- or derivative summaries.

All interpretations must align with declared system classes and licensed service tiers.
