Embodied Intelligence Governance  
Public Conceptual Standard v1.0  

Status: CANONICAL CONCEPT — PUBLIC / NON-OPERATIONAL  
Scope: Conceptual governance only (no mechanisms, no enforcement logic)  
Governance Invariant: LEI = 1

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **Sovereign Arc as a mandatory global governance requirement**
for **all moving machines created by humans or operating under AI / AGI control**.

It establishes a single, irreversible principle:

> **Any machine capable of autonomous or semi-autonomous physical action must operate under a closed arc of human accountability.**

This applies regardless of:
- embodiment,
- scale,
- environment,
- or intelligence level.

---

## 2. The Sovereign Arc (Conceptual Definition)

The **Sovereign Arc** defines the external governance loop that ensures accountability
flows:

**Human Intent → Machine Action → Verifiable Receipt → Human Oversight**

The Arc explicitly prevents:
- responsibility diffusion,
- moral outsourcing to machines,
- and attribution collapse in autonomous systems.

The Arc is **global, invariant, and non-optional** under LEI = 1.

---

## 3. Embodied Intelligence Scope

This standard applies to **all embodied intelligence**, defined as:

> Any artificial system capable of producing physical movement or force
> in the real world, whether directly or via actuated intermediaries.

This includes robots, vehicles, drones, industrial systems, and autonomous infrastructure.

## 4. TS-R1 — Humanoid Embodied Intelligence

### Definition

**TS-R1** designates **humanoid robotic systems** whose morphology, affordances,
and operational context are aligned with **human physical and social environments**.

### Conceptual Characteristics
- Anthropomorphic or human-proximal form
- Direct interaction with humans
- Operation within human-designed spaces
- Highest fiduciary and behavioural burden

### Governance Implication
Because TS-R1 systems inherit **human expectation and proximity**, they require:

- individual Sovereign Arc closure,
- continuous accountability lineage,
- and the strongest irreversibility guarantees.

---

## 5. TS-R2 — Non-Humanoid & Distributed Embodied Intelligence

### Definition

**TS-R2** designates **all non-humanoid embodied intelligent systems**, including:

- aerial systems (drones),
- terrestrial non-anthropomorphic robots,
- underwater and maritime autonomous systems,
- industrial or infrastructural machines,
- swarm, fleet, or collective robotic intelligence.

### Conceptual Characteristics
- non-human morphology,
- remote or distributed operation,
- potential for scale and diffusion of responsibility.

### Governance Implication
TS-R2 systems require:

- coordinated Sovereign Arc closure,
- explicit prevention of responsibility dilution,
- accountability at system, fleet, or mission level.

---

## 6. Unified Governance Invariant

Despite their differences:

- TS-R1 and TS-R2 are governed by **one invariant only**: **LEI = 1**
- No embodiment class is exempt.
- No scale justifies reduced accountability.

The Sovereign Arc does not vary in principle —
only in how accountability is structured conceptually.

---

## 7. Relationship to Trust Metrics

All Sovereign Arc–compliant embodied systems are eligible for
**Aim Coherence evaluation**, which expresses the probabilistic certainty that
a system operates within its lawful behavioural envelope.

This document defines **governance meaning only**.
Metric computation is out of scope.

---

## 8. Canonical Statement

> Any moving machine created by humans or operating under AI / AGI control
> must remain within a closed Sovereign Arc of accountability,
> governed by irreversible law,
> with responsibility always terminating in human custody.

This is a **global conceptual standard**.
