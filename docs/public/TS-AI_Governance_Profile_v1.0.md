## 1. SYSTEM CLASS SCOPE (WHAT IS GOVERNED)

This system class applies to Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that perform bounded, task-specific cognitive functions without independent goal formation or generalized reasoning capability.

AI systems governed under this class include analytical models, decision-support engines, optimisation systems, pattern-recognition models, forecasting tools, classification engines, and automated evaluation mechanisms used across commercial, institutional, and governmental environments.

These systems may materially influence decisions made by humans or organisations but do not autonomously define objectives, pursue long-horizon strategies, or execute irreversible actions without external authorization.

This class explicitly covers AI systems embedded in enterprise software, regulated workflows, public-sector decision support, research platforms, and operational analytics pipelines.

AI systems operating continuously, adapting parameters, or influencing outcomes at scale remain within this class provided they lack autonomous goal-setting authority.

Systems that cross into generalized reasoning, self-directed planning, or autonomous action escalation fall outside this class and must be governed under the AGI or Robotics system classes.

This scope excludes human-only decision processes, static rule engines without learning components, and non-cognitive automation.

TruthSeal™ governance applies to the behaviour, outputs, and operational use of AI systems, not to their internal model architectures or training methodologies.

## 2. GOVERNANCE OBJECTIVE

The objective of governance for AI systems is to ensure that intelligence outputs relied upon by humans, institutions, or automated workflows remain coherent, lawful, traceable, and accountable at all times.

AI systems often operate at speed and scale that exceeds human review capacity, creating dependency on outputs whose origin, reasoning context, or decision pathway may otherwise become opaque.

TruthSeal™ governance addresses this dependency by ensuring that AI-generated outputs can be audited, reconstructed, attributed, and examined after the fact without ambiguity.

The objective is not to assess intelligence quality or correctness, but to guarantee that reliance on AI outputs never dissolves human responsibility or institutional accountability.

Governance ensures that decisions influenced by AI remain defensible under regulatory, legal, contractual, or public scrutiny.

This objective applies equally to low-risk advisory use and high-volume enterprise deployment where cumulative impact becomes significant.

TruthSeal™ governance establishes continuity between AI output, human decision authority, and legal responsibility.

This preserves trust without granting autonomy.

---

## 3. ACTIVE GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS

For AI systems under this class, TruthSeal™ activates governance and audit systems designed to observe, record, and attribute AI behaviour without intervening in execution.

Active systems include decision provenance recording, output traceability mechanisms, integrity logging, and structured audit trail generation.

Each governed AI output is linked to contextual metadata that allows later reconstruction of decision conditions, system state, and responsible authority.

Governance systems operate continuously but do not alter AI outputs or halt execution.

Audit readiness is maintained through standardized evidence structures suitable for regulators, courts, insurers, and internal oversight bodies.

Governance systems ensure that AI outputs cannot be detached from their origin, timing, or accountable operator.

No enforcement or containment systems capable of blocking actions are active under this class.

These systems support transparency, not control.

---

## 4. ENFORCEMENT & ESCALATION MODEL

AI systems governed under this class operate without direct enforcement intervention by TruthSeal™.

Escalation mechanisms are limited to alerting, reporting, and evidentiary signaling when anomalies, integrity concerns, or governance thresholds are crossed.

All escalation outputs are informational and directed to authorized human operators or institutions.

TruthSeal™ does not suspend, block, or override AI execution within this class.

Escalation exists to ensure visibility and accountability, not to impose operational control.

Human decision-makers remain fully responsible for interpreting outputs and acting upon alerts.

Where enforcement or intervention is required, systems must be governed under a higher system class.

This model preserves proportional governance aligned to bounded AI capability.

---

## 5. ACCOUNTABILITY & RELIANCE

Reliance on TruthSeal™ governance for AI systems means reliance on provable traceability, attribution, and auditability of AI outputs.

Users may rely on the ability to demonstrate how AI outputs were generated, used, and acted upon.

TruthSeal™ governance ensures that responsibility for AI-influenced decisions cannot be denied, obscured, or displaced onto automation.

Human and institutional accountability remains intact at all times.

TruthSeal™ does not assume responsibility for decision outcomes, system objectives, or deployment choices.

Reliance is limited to governance evidence, not outcome validation.

This enables lawful use of AI in regulated and high-scrutiny environments.

---

## 6. EXCLUSIONS & NON-GUARANTEES

TruthSeal™ does not guarantee correctness, accuracy, fairness, or desirability of AI outputs.

TruthSeal™ does not certify AI model quality, training data integrity, or performance metrics.

TruthSeal™ does not prevent misuse of AI outputs by humans.

Governance does not substitute for professional judgment, regulatory compliance, or ethical review.

AI systems operating outside declared scope are not covered.

Misclassification of systems voids governance reliance.

This class does not provide autonomous containment, override, or shutdown capability.
