**TRUTHSEAL™ — GOVERNANCE GUARANTEES & NON-CLAIMS
Public Canonical Document**

**date: 2025-12-24**
version: 1.0

------------------------------------------------------------
**1. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT**

This document defines the formal governance guarantees provided by TruthSeal™ and the explicit boundaries of what TruthSeal™ does not claim or provide.

Its purpose is to enable governments, regulators, courts, enterprises, insurers, and institutional stakeholders to rely on TruthSeal™ governance with legal clarity, without misinterpretation, overstatement, or ambiguity.

This document is authoritative for interpreting TruthSeal™ guarantees, exclusions, and scope of responsibility.

⸻

**2. WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ GUARANTEES**

TruthSeal™ guarantees the continuous governance, auditability, enforcement capability, and human accountability of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems that are licensed and operated under active TruthSeal™ governance.

Specifically, TruthSeal™ guarantees that governed systems are:

• Traceable — all governed actions, outputs, and decisions are attributable and auditable
• Provable — governance events are cryptographically recorded and verifiable
• Enforceable — governance conditions, restrictions, and controls are actively applied
• Accountable — responsibility remains bound to identifiable human or institutional authority
• Non-repudiable — responsibility cannot be denied, obscured, or displaced by automation

These guarantees apply continuously while TruthSeal™ governance is active and properly licensed.

⸻

**3. NATURE OF THE GUARANTEE**

TruthSeal™ guarantees governance integrity, not outcome perfection.

The guarantee ensures that AI, AGI, and autonomous systems operate within a provable governance perimeter where:

• Authority is declared
• Responsibility is assigned
• Actions are logged
• Violations are detectable
• Enforcement pathways exist

TruthSeal™ governance functions analogously to critical infrastructure control systems such as aviation control, traffic management, or financial clearing systems: it does not eliminate risk, but it makes risk governable, attributable, and lawful.

⸻

**4. RELIANCE AND LAWFUL DEPENDENCE**

Institutions may lawfully rely on TruthSeal™ governance to:

• Establish accountability chains
• Enable regulatory oversight
• Support judicial review and evidence
• Underwrite insurance and compliance decisions
• Enforce licensing and operational constraints

Reliance on TruthSeal™ governance is reliance on verifiable control and accountability, not reliance on system infallibility.

This reliance is designed to support lawful operation in high-consequence environments.

⸻

**5. HUMAN ACCOUNTABILITY GUARANTEE**

TruthSeal™ guarantees that human accountability is preserved at all times.

No AI, AGI, or autonomous system governed by TruthSeal™ may:

• Hold legal responsibility
• Replace accountable authority
• Obscure decision ownership
• Displace liability onto automation

Responsibility always follows authority.
Automation does not absolve accountability.

This guarantee is absolute within governed scope.

⸻

**6. WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ DOES NOT CLAIM**

TruthSeal™ does not claim, imply, or guarantee:

• Correctness of system outputs
• Ethical desirability of outcomes
• Absence of harm or failure
• Intelligence quality or capability
• Intentional alignment or moral judgement
• System infallibility

TruthSeal™ is not an AI service provider, does not generate intelligence outputs, and does not evaluate the “quality” of intelligence.

TruthSeal™ governs how systems operate under law, not what decisions they should make.

⸻

**7. SCOPE-BOUND GUARANTEES**

All TruthSeal™ guarantees apply only within declared and licensed scope, defined by:

• System class (AI, AGI, robotic, infrastructure, defence, etc.)
• Activated service tier
• Enabled governance layers

No guarantee exists for systems, actions, outputs, or protections outside declared coverage.

Governance guarantees do not extend beyond licensed scope.

⸻

**8. MISREPRESENTATION AND INVALID CLAIMS**

Any claim that a system is “TruthSeal™ governed” without active licensing, enforcement, and audit coverage is invalid.

Any representation that extends TruthSeal™ guarantees beyond declared scope constitutes misrepresentation.

TruthSeal™ reserves the right to revoke governance, licensing, and mark usage in cases of misrepresentation or misuse.

⸻

**9. FINAL AUTHORITY**

This document is the authoritative public reference for interpreting TruthSeal™ governance guarantees and exclusions.

In case of conflict, this document supersedes marketing materials, presentations, or informal explanations.

All interpretations must align with declared system classes, service tiers, and active governance layers.
