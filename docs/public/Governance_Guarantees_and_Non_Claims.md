**TRUTHSEAL™ — GOVERNANCE GUARANTEES & NON-CLAIMS
Public Canonical Document**

**date: 2025-12-24**
version: 1.0

------------------------------------------------------------

**1. PURPOSE OF GOVERNANCE GUARANTEES**

This document defines the explicit guarantees provided by TruthSeal™
and the equally explicit boundaries of what TruthSeal™ does not provide.

Its purpose is to eliminate ambiguity for governments, institutions,
enterprises, regulators, insurers, courts, and other stakeholders
regarding what reliance on TruthSeal™ governance systems means in
operational, legal, and accountability terms.

TruthSeal™ operates as a governance, audit, enforcement, and
accountability organisation for Artificial Intelligence (AI),
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems.

This document exists to prevent misinterpretation of TruthSeal™ as
an intelligence producer, safety predictor, or decision-making system.

All guarantees described herein apply only to systems that are
properly licensed, deployed, and operated within declared system
classes and service tiers.

No guarantee exists outside declared scope, active governance layers,
and continuous operational enforcement.

------------------------------------------------------------

**2. WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ GUARANTEES**

TruthSeal™ guarantees that governed AI, AGI, and autonomous robotic
systems operate under continuous, auditable governance constraints
defined by licensed system classes and service tiers.

TruthSeal™ guarantees that governed systems produce outputs, actions,
and behaviours that are cryptographically traceable, logged, and
provable through immutable governance records.

TruthSeal™ guarantees that every governed system action subject to
TruthSeal™ enforcement is attributable to a legally accountable
human authority or institution.

TruthSeal™ guarantees continuous coherence auditing of governed
systems relative to declared objectives, permissions, and constraints.

TruthSeal™ guarantees enforceable intervention capability, including
escalation, suspension, or termination of governed operations where
licensed thresholds are breached.

TruthSeal™ guarantees resistance to post-quantum and quantum-era
integrity attacks within the scope of activated governance systems
and licensed protections.

TruthSeal™ guarantees that no governed system may operate silently,
without auditability, or without accountable authority.

------------------------------------------------------------

**3. WHAT TRUTHSEAL™ EXPLICITLY DOES NOT PROVIDE**

TruthSeal™ does not develop Artificial Intelligence models,
Artificial General Intelligence systems, or robotic platforms.

TruthSeal™ does not generate intelligence outputs, predictions,
decisions, recommendations, or actions.

TruthSeal™ does not guarantee correctness, accuracy, usefulness,
or desirability of intelligence outputs produced by external systems.

TruthSeal™ does not replace human judgment, institutional authority,
or legal responsibility.

TruthSeal™ does not certify intent, morality, or outcome quality;
it governs process, accountability, and enforceability.

TruthSeal™ does not eliminate operational risk, strategic risk,
or societal risk inherent in advanced intelligence systems.

TruthSeal™ does not assume ownership, authorship, or operational
control of governed systems.

Any claim that TruthSeal™ “ensures safe outcomes” or “guarantees
correct decisions” is invalid and unauthorised.

------------------------------------------------------------

**4. RELIANCE, LIABILITY, AND HUMAN ACCOUNTABILITY**

Reliance on TruthSeal™ governance means reliance on provable
accountability, not reliance on system infallibility.

All responsibility for deployment decisions, system design,
training data, objectives, and use cases remains with system owners
and operators.

TruthSeal™ governance ensures that responsibility cannot be denied,
obscured, or displaced by automation.

Human accountability is preserved at all times, regardless of
system autonomy, scale, or complexity.

TruthSeal™ governance enables lawful reliance by institutions,
courts, insurers, and regulators by making accountability verifiable.

No delegation of legal responsibility to machines is permitted under
TruthSeal™ governance.

Liability follows authority, not automation.

------------------------------------------------------------

**5. MISREPRESENTATION AND INVALID CLAIMS**

Any representation that a system is “TruthSeal™ governed” without
active licensing, enforcement, and audit coverage is invalid.

Any use of TruthSeal™ marks, references, or claims outside declared
system classes and service tiers constitutes misrepresentation.

TruthSeal™ governance may not be used to imply certification of
intelligence quality, ethical intent, or outcome desirability.

Claims of coverage beyond licensed scope are void.

TruthSeal™ reserves the right to revoke governance, licensing,
and mark usage where misrepresentation occurs.

------------------------------------------------------------

**6. RELATIONSHIP TO SYSTEM CLASSES AND SERVICE TIERS**

All guarantees apply strictly within the boundaries defined by
licensed system classes and activated service tiers.

System classes define what type of AI, AGI, or robotic system is
governed.

Service tiers define which governance, audit, enforcement, and
accountability systems are active.

No guarantee exists for systems, layers, or protections not explicitly
included in licensed coverage.

Tier-to-system mappings determine the depth of enforcement and audit.

------------------------------------------------------------

**7. FINAL AUTHORITY AND INTERPRETATION**

This document is the authoritative public reference for interpreting
TruthSeal™ governance guarantees and exclusions.

In case of conflict, this document supersedes marketing material,
presentations, or informal explanations.

All interpretations must align with declared system classes, service
tiers, and active governance layers.

TruthSeal™ governance is enforceable only within declared scope.
