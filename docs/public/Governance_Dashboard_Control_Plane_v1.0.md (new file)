## 1. PURPOSE OF THE GOVERNANCE DASHBOARD & CONTROL PLANE

The Governance Dashboard & Control Plane defines the observable and enforceable governance interface through which TruthSeal™ oversight is exercised.

This control plane does not operate, command, train, or influence AI, AGI, or robotic systems directly.

It exists to make governance states visible, verifiable, auditable, and legally interpretable at all times.

The dashboard provides structured visibility into system classification, certification status, active governance controls, and escalation posture.

It enables regulators, courts, enterprises, insurers, and authorised institutions to determine governance coverage without technical ambiguity.

The control plane serves as the authoritative governance surface for reliance and accountability interpretation.

TruthSeal™ governance actions occur through policy enforcement, certification state changes, and escalation authority — not system execution.

---

## 2. GOVERNANCE SURFACES DEFINED

The control plane exposes governance-relevant surfaces only.

These include system classification, licensed tier, certification state, audit status, escalation thresholds, and enforcement posture.

Each surface represents a verifiable governance fact backed by audit records and immutable logs.

No model internals, training data, source code, weights, or proprietary algorithms are exposed.

Governance surfaces are structured to support legal review, regulatory supervision, and institutional reliance.

All displayed information is derived from certified governance records.

The dashboard is a governance interface, not an analytics or operational console.

---

## 3. VISIBILITY, ACCESS, AND ROLES

Access to the Governance Dashboard is role-based and authority-scoped.

Different stakeholders may see different governance views depending on legal authority and licensing rights.

Operators may view certification status and obligations applicable to their systems.

Regulators and courts may view full governance state, audit history, and escalation events.

Insurers and institutional partners may view reliance-relevant certification and compliance indicators.

No unauthorised party may access restricted governance surfaces.

All access events are logged for audit integrity.

---

## 4. CONTROL PLANE ACTIONS

The control plane enables governance actions, not operational commands.

Actions include certification issuance, suspension, revocation, escalation triggers, and governance state transitions.

No action may directly instruct system behaviour, decision-making, or execution.

Control plane actions affect governance status only.

All actions require defined authority, authentication, and recorded justification.

Every action generates an immutable governance record.

---

## 5. LOGGING, AUDIT, AND CONTINUITY

All governance states and actions are continuously logged.

Logs are structured to support long-term auditability and legal admissibility.

Historical governance states remain retrievable even after suspension or revocation.

No governance action may occur without a corresponding audit trail.

The control plane maintains continuity across system updates, redeployments, and lifecycle changes.

Governance history cannot be retroactively altered.

---

## 6. LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS

The Governance Dashboard & Control Plane does not monitor model internals or runtime cognition.

It does not guarantee outcomes, correctness, safety, or performance of governed systems.

It does not replace regulatory authority, legal judgment, or human responsibility.

Its function is limited to governance visibility, certification enforcement, and accountability continuity.

Reliance is limited to declared governance coverage only.
