TRUTHSEAL™ — GOVERNANCE DASHBOARD & CONTROL PLANE  
Public Canonical Document

date: 2025-12-25  
version: 1.0

---

## 1. PURPOSE OF THE GOVERNANCE CONTROL PLANE

The Governance Dashboard & Control Plane defines how TruthSeal™ governance visibility, audit access, escalation signals, and enforcement states are surfaced to authorised parties.

This control plane does not operate, command, or execute Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), or robotic systems.

It exists to make governance observable, accountable, and legally reviewable across the lifecycle of governed systems.

The dashboard provides structured visibility into governance state, not system performance or intelligence quality.

It enables regulators, courts, enterprises, insurers, and sovereign authorities to determine whether a system is operating within declared governance conditions.

The control plane is a governance interface, not an operational console.

TruthSeal™ governance actions occur through contractual, legal, and enforcement mechanisms — not direct system control.

---

## 2. GOVERNANCE SURFACES DEFINED

The control plane exposes governance-relevant surfaces only.

These include system classification, licensed service tier, active governance layers, audit status, integrity signals, escalation markers, and enforcement state.

Each surface represents a verifiable governance condition tied to declared scope and licensing.

No model internals, training data, source code, or proprietary system logic is exposed.

Governance surfaces are structured to support legal interpretation, regulatory review, and institutional reliance.

All displayed information is derived from audit records, receipts, and governance logs.

The control plane reflects governance reality; it does not infer, predict, or simulate behaviour.

---

## 3. VISIBILITY — WHO SEES WHAT

Visibility is role-based and jurisdiction-aware.

System operators may view governance status, alerts, and compliance indicators relevant to their licensed systems.

Regulators and courts may access certified audit records, decision receipts, escalation history, and enforcement state.

Insurers may access governance continuity indicators and certification validity relevant to risk assessment.

Sovereign authorities may access expanded audit depth where contractually and legally authorised.

No party receives unrestricted access by default.

Visibility does not imply authority to modify systems or governance parameters.

---

## 4. AUTHORITY — WHO CAN ACT (AND WHO CANNOT)

TruthSeal™ does not operate, modify, or command external systems.

TruthSeal™ cannot trigger system actions, deploy updates, alter objectives, or execute controls.

Authority to act on governed systems remains with system owners, operators, or legally designated human authorities.

TruthSeal™ governance may trigger escalation signals, suspension conditions, or certification state changes as defined by license.

These actions affect governance status, not system execution.

All enforcement occurs through legal, contractual, or institutional mechanisms — not technical takeover.

---

## 5. ESCALATION AND INTERVENTION LOGIC

Escalation signals are generated when governance conditions are breached or at risk.

Signals may include integrity violations, scope deviation, undeclared autonomy, audit failure, or misuse indicators.

Escalation does not equal intervention.

Escalation notifies authorised human authorities and relevant institutions according to tier and system class.

Intervention decisions are executed by humans under legal authority, not by TruthSeal™.

This separation preserves accountability and prevents displacement of responsibility onto automated systems.

---

## 6. LOGGING, EVIDENCE, AND AUDIT CONTINUITY

All governance-relevant events are logged as structured, immutable records.

Logs include certification state, audit checkpoints, escalation events, enforcement actions, and suspension or revocation decisions.

Records are retained according to declared audit lifecycle and jurisdictional requirements.

Logs are designed to be admissible, reviewable, and reconstructable in legal or regulatory proceedings.

Audit continuity ensures governance state can be assessed retrospectively and longitudinally.

TruthSeal™ logs support accountability without asserting outcome correctness.

---

## 7. EXPLICIT EXCLUSIONS AND NON-CLAIMS

The Governance Dashboard does not guarantee system safety, correctness, or performance.

It does not predict failures, prevent harm, or certify intelligence quality.

It does not replace human judgment, legal oversight, or operational responsibility.

No governance visibility implies approval of system objectives or outcomes.

TruthSeal™ governance ensures accountability, not infallibility.

All reliance must align with declared system class, licensed tier, and active governance scope.
