## Purpose of This Document

This document explains **what TruthSeal™ is**, in clear, public, and technically responsible terms.

It exists to:
- orient first-time readers,
- establish institutional clarity,
- prevent mischaracterisation or dilution.

---

## What TruthSeal™ Is

TruthSeal™ is a **sovereign governance framework** for the behaviour and evolution of artificial intelligence.

It defines how intelligence:
- grows,
- generalises,
- and evolves toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
**under irreversible law**.

TruthSeal™ treats AGI not as a performance milestone,
but as a **behavioural state that must remain coherent under growth**.

---

## Core Principle

The foundational invariant of TruthSeal™ is:

**LEI = 1 — Law of Ethical Irreversibility**

Once a safer, more coherent behavioural path is known,
it must not be weakened, bypassed, or traded for optimisation.

This principle governs all public and internal TruthSeal™ doctrine.

---

## What TruthSeal™ Provides

At a conceptual level, TruthSeal™ provides:

- a unified framework for accountable intelligence evolution,
- a shared language for institutions, researchers, and regulators,
- a behavioural definition of AGI grounded in coherence, not hype,
- a public reference point for irreversible AI governance.

TruthSeal™ is designed to be intelligible to:
- technical experts,
- policy and regulatory bodies,
- academic institutions,
- and long-horizon system architects.

---

## Relationship to AGI

TruthSeal™ defines AGI as:

> Intelligence that can generalise across domains  
> **without losing coherence, accountability, or ethical stability**.

Capability alone is insufficient.

AGI is recognised **only when behaviour remains aligned under scale**.

---

## What TruthSeal™ Is Not

TruthSeal™ is not:
- a chatbot,
- a benchmark leaderboard,
- a marketing layer,
- a single model or vendor,
- or a shortcut to AGI.

It does not promise timelines, performance claims, or deployment paths.

---

## Why TruthSeal™ Exists

TruthSeal™ exists because:
- intelligence scaling without governance leads to regression,
- optimisation without irreversibility produces instability,
- and AGI without behavioural law is unsafe by construction.

TruthSeal™ establishes a **sovereign arc** where progress cannot outpace responsibility.
