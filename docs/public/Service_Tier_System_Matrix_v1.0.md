**TRUTHSEAL™ — SERVICE TIER × SYSTEM CLASS MATRIX
Public Canonical Document**

**date: 2025-12-25
version: 1.0**

---

## 1. PURPOSE OF THIS MATRIX

This document provides the authoritative mapping between TruthSeal™ service tiers and governed system classes.

It defines which system classes are permitted under each service tier, which governance systems are active, what guarantees apply, and what is explicitly excluded.

This matrix removes ambiguity for governments, regulators, enterprises, courts, insurers, and institutional buyers.

This document is binding for licensing interpretation, governance reliance, and enforcement scope.

---

## 2. SYSTEM CLASSES DEFINED

• TS-AI — Artificial Intelligence Systems  
• TS-AGI — Artificial General Intelligence Systems  
• TS-R — Robotic & Cyber-Physical Systems  
• TS-DEF — Defence, Military & Space Systems  

System classes define **what is governed**, not performance or capability.

---

## 3. SERVICE TIERS DEFINED

• Base Tier — Foundational AI Governance  
• Standard Tier — Enterprise & Regulated AI Governance  
• Supreme Tier — AGI, Robotics & High-Impact Systems  
• Ultra / Sovereign Tier — Defence, Military & Space  

Service tiers define **governance depth**, not software features.

## 4. SERVICE TIER × SYSTEM CLASS MATRIX

| Service Tier | TS-AI | TS-AGI | TS-R | TS-DEF |
|-------------|------|--------|------|--------|
| Base Tier | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Not Permitted | ❌ Not Permitted | ❌ Not Permitted |
| Standard Tier | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Not Permitted | ❌ Not Permitted | ❌ Not Permitted |
| Supreme Tier | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | ❌ Not Permitted |
| Ultra / Sovereign Tier | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed | ✅ Allowed |

## 5. ACTIVE GOVERNANCE BY TIER

### Base Tier
• Decision provenance logging  
• Output traceability  
• Audit-ready records  
• Post-hoc accountability  

No enforcement, containment, or intervention systems active.

---

### Standard Tier
• Continuous audit readiness  
• Integrity monitoring  
• Escalation signalling  
• Accountability mapping  

No autonomous intervention or execution control.

---

### Supreme Tier
• Runtime governance  
• Pre-execution legitimacy checks  
• Human override enforcement  
• Immutable decision records  

Mandatory human authority binding.

---

### Ultra / Sovereign Tier
• Real-time enforcement  
• Containment and override  
• Sovereign-grade audit continuity  
• Hardened escalation authority  

Applies only under explicit sovereign mandate.

---

## 6. EXCLUSIONS & MISUSE

Use of a system class above the licensed tier constitutes misuse.

Misclassification voids reliance and guarantees.

TruthSeal™ does not permit TS-AGI, TS-R, or TS-DEF systems under Base or Standard tiers.

Outcome guarantees, performance guarantees, and operational success are explicitly excluded at all tiers.

---

## 7. RELIANCE RULE

Reliance on TruthSeal™ governance applies **only** within the bounds of this matrix.

No governance, audit, enforcement, or accountability guarantees exist outside declared tier and system class alignment.
