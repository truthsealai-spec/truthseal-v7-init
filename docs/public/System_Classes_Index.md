**TRUTHSEAL™ — SYSTEM CLASSES INDEX
Version: 1.0
Status: Public Canonical Reference
Date: 2025-12-25**

────────────────────────────────────────

**1. PURPOSE OF THIS INDEX**

This document provides the authoritative public index of all TruthSeal™ system classes.

System classes define the categories of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), autonomous robotic, infrastructure, and defence systems to which TruthSeal™ governance, audit, enforcement, and accountability systems may be applied.

This index exists to remove ambiguity for governments, regulators, enterprises, courts, insurers, and institutional stakeholders.

────────────────────────────────────────
**2. ROLE OF SYSTEM CLASSES IN TRUTHSEAL™**

System classes are legal and operational governance categories.

They do not describe intelligence quality, performance, or desirability.
They define:
• what type of AI, AGI, or robotic system is governed,
• what level of real-world consequence is present,
• which governance layers are mandatory,
• which service tiers are permitted,
• and which authorities may lawfully rely on governed outputs or actions.

────────────────────────────────────────
**3. CANONICAL SYSTEM CLASSES**

The following system classes are recognised under TruthSeal™:

────────────────────────────────────────
TS-AI — Artificial Intelligence System Class  
Governs bounded, non-general AI systems operating in live production or decision-support environments where outputs influence legal, financial, operational, or societal outcomes.

────────────────────────────────────────
TS-AGI — Artificial General Intelligence System Class  
Governs cross-domain, adaptive intelligence systems capable of generalised reasoning, autonomous planning, strategy generation, and behavioural evolution beyond fixed task constraints.

────────────────────────────────────────
TS-R — Robotic System Class  
Governs robotic and cyber-physical systems that execute physical actions in the real world under algorithmic, AI, or AGI control.

────────────────────────────────────────
TS-INFRA — Critical Infrastructure System Class  
Governs AI, AGI, and automated systems that manage, influence, or constrain critical infrastructure including energy, transport, communications, finance, healthcare, emergency response, and essential public services.

────────────────────────────────────────
TS-DEF — Defence, Military & Space System Class  
Governs AI, AGI, autonomous, cyber-physical, and decision systems deployed in defence, military, intelligence, national security, and space-based environments.

────────────────────────────────────────
**4. RELATIONSHIP TO SERVICE TIERS**

System classes define *what* is governed.  
Service tiers define *how deeply* governance is applied.

No governance, audit, enforcement, or accountability guarantee exists unless:
• a system class is declared, and
• an appropriate service tier is actively licensed.

Certain system classes impose mandatory tier requirements.

────────────────────────────────────────
**5. NON-OVERLAP AND COMPOSITION**

System classes may be composed in layered architectures.

Where systems span multiple classes:
• the highest-risk class governs,
• enforcement depth escalates accordingly,
• and accountability chains must remain continuous across layers.

Fragmented or partial classification is invalid.

────────────────────────────────────────
**6. AUTHORITATIVE STATUS**

This document is the authoritative public index of TruthSeal™ system classes.

In case of conflict, this index supersedes:
• marketing materials,
• presentations,
• informal explanations,
• or derivative summaries.

All interpretations must align with declared system classes and licensed service tiers.
