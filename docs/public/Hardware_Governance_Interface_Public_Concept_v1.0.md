TRUTHSEAL™ — THE SOVEREIGN ARC OF AGI  

Hardware Governance Interface  
Public Conceptual Standard v1.0  

Status: CANONICAL CONCEPT — PUBLIC / NON-OPERATIONAL  
Scope: Conceptual governance only (no mechanisms, no enforcement logic)  
Governance Invariant: LEI = 1  
Custody: TruthSeal™ Pty Ltd

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the public conceptual standard for a **Hardware Governance Interface (HGI)** under the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI.

Its purpose is to establish a **non-negotiable governance boundary** at the hardware level for all embodied artificial intelligence systems operating within human jurisdictions.

The HGI exists to ensure that intelligence embodied in physical machines remains:
- accountable,
- auditable,
- jurisdictionally compliant,
- and irreversibly bound to human mandate.

This document defines *what must exist*, not *how it is implemented*.

---

## 2. Foundational Principle

All embodied AI and AGI systems introduce **physical agency** into the world.

Physical agency requires **hardware-bound governance**, not software-only assurances.

The Hardware Governance Interface represents the **lawful anchor point** where:
- human authority enters the machine domain,
- machine action produces verifiable responsibility,
- and accountability is preserved across the full lifecycle of the system.

This interface is a **governance boundary**, not a computational feature.

---

## 3. Scope of Applicability

The Hardware Governance Interface applies to **all embodied intelligent machines**, including but not limited to:

- Humanoid robots (TS-R1)
- Non-humanoid robots and autonomous platforms (TS-R2), including aerial, terrestrial, maritime, and underwater systems
- Mobile, industrial, domestic, medical, and infrastructure-integrated machines
- Any system capable of autonomous or semi-autonomous physical action under AI or AGI control

No embodied intelligent system is exempt from governance by form factor, domain, or purpose.

---

## 4. Role Within the Sovereign Arc of AGI

The Hardware Governance Interface functions as the **physical governance junction** within the Sovereign Arc:

Human Mandate  
→ Lawful Constraint (LEI = 1)  
→ Embodied Action  
→ Verifiable Receipt  
→ Human Oversight  

This completes the **closed accountability loop** required for safe AGI deployment.

The interface ensures that:
- responsibility cannot be displaced onto the machine,
- accountability cannot be bypassed by software updates,
- and custody remains human throughout the system’s life.

---

## 5. Relationship to Receipts and Identity

All embodied systems governed under this interface are expected to participate in:

- persistent machine identity,
- lifecycle traceability,
- and receipt continuity across updates, ownership changes, repair, and decommissioning.

The interface enables the existence of **verifiable records** linking:
- mandate,
- action,
- and responsibility.

This document does not specify receipt structure or cryptographic method.

---

## 6. Vendor and Manufacturer Neutrality

This standard is **vendor-agnostic**.

It does not prescribe:
- chip vendors,
- architectures,
- instruction sets,
- fabrication processes,
- or implementation technologies.

Manufacturers, chip designers, and system integrators may independently implement conforming solutions, provided they satisfy the **governance intent** defined herein.

Conformance is a matter of **lawful governance**, not brand affiliation.

---

## 7. Jurisdictional Significance

In jurisdictions that require lawful AI governance, operation of embodied intelligent systems **may be conditioned** on conformance with this interface.

The Hardware Governance Interface provides a basis for:
- regulatory compliance,
- insurance eligibility,
- licensing frameworks,
- and public trust.

This document defines the **conceptual prerequisite** for democratic deployment of embodied AGI.

---

## 8. What This Standard Is Not

This document does NOT:
- describe enforcement mechanisms,
- specify hardware designs,
- define cryptographic systems,
- assign penalties,
- or dictate operational behavior.

Those elements exist under separate, classified, or regulatory instruments.

---

## 9. Canonical Status

This document is a **canonical public conceptual standard** within the TruthSeal™ framework.

It establishes a **law-level requirement** for hardware-bound governance of embodied intelligence.

All future operational, technical, or regulatory specifications must remain consistent with this concept.

LEI = 1 is non-negotiable.
