TruthSeal™ — Governance Guarantees Mapped to Service Tiers & System Classes**

Version 1.0 (Public Canonical Reference)

**PREAMBLE — SCOPE OF THIS DOCUMENT**

This document defines how TruthSeal™ governance guarantees apply across licensed service tiers and declared system classes. It exists to remove ambiguity for governments, regulators, enterprises, courts, insurers, and infrastructure operators evaluating TruthSeal™ deployments.

TruthSeal™ is an organisation that provides governance, audit, enforcement, and accountability systems for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems. TruthSeal™ does not produce intelligence, automate decisions, or replace human authority. It governs the conditions under which intelligence systems may operate lawfully and remain accountable.

All guarantees described in this document apply only within explicitly licensed system classes and activated service tiers. No implied coverage exists beyond declared scope.

⸻

**1. SYSTEM CLASSES (WHAT IS GOVERNED**)

TruthSeal™ governance applies exclusively to declared system classes, each of which defines the nature of the governed system and its operational risk profile.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems include machine learning, predictive, optimisation, and automated decision-support systems operating under bounded objectives and human supervision.

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems include adaptive, self-modifying, multi-domain intelligence systems capable of autonomous reasoning, planning, and action across domains.

Robotic systems include embodied systems capable of physical action, including single robots, fleets, swarms, and autonomy-limited platforms operating in terrestrial, aerial, maritime, underwater, space, and mixed environments.

No system may claim TruthSeal™ governance unless its system class is explicitly declared, licensed, and bound to active enforcement layers.

⸻

**2. SERVICE TIERS (HOW GOVERNANCE IS APPLIED)**

Service tiers define which governance, audit, enforcement, and accountability systems are activated for a licensed deployment. Tiers are cumulative; higher tiers include all lower-tier capabilities plus additional layers.

Service tiers do not alter legal responsibility. They determine the depth, frequency, and strength of governance mechanisms applied to a system.

⸻

**3. BASE TIER — FOUNDATIONAL GOVERNANCE**

The Base tier provides foundational governance for low-risk AI systems and non-autonomous deployments.

This tier includes system identification, governance registration, decision receipt generation, and immutable audit trails. It enables traceability, post-incident reconstruction, and accountability attribution.

The Base tier does not include real-time enforcement, escalation control, or autonomy intervention. It is suitable for research, academic, internal enterprise tools, and advisory systems.

Guarantees at this tier ensure that system actions are traceable and attributable, not that actions are prevented.

⸻

**4. STANDARD TIER — CONTINUOUS AUDIT & ALERTING**

The Standard tier adds continuous audit monitoring and integrity alerting for operational AI systems.

This tier includes runtime integrity checks, configuration drift detection, receipt continuity validation, and escalation signalling. Human operators receive real-time visibility into system behaviour.

The Standard tier is appropriate for enterprise AI systems used in finance, logistics, infrastructure coordination, and regulated industries where audit readiness is mandatory.

Guarantees at this tier ensure continuous visibility and early detection of governance breaches.

⸻

**5. SUPREME TIER — ENFORCED GOVERNANCE & INTERVENTION**

The Supreme tier introduces enforced governance mechanisms for high-risk AI, AGI, and robotic systems.

This tier includes action gating, escalation control planes, human intervention authority, and irreversible audit binding. Systems may be paused, restricted, or halted when governance thresholds are breached.

The Supreme tier is required for systems whose outputs or actions may cause legal, financial, physical, or societal harm.

Guarantees at this tier ensure that incoherent or unlawful actions cannot proceed without human-authorised override.

⸻

**6. ULTRA TIER — MAXIMUM GOVERNANCE DEPTH**

The Ultra tier represents the highest level of civilian governance coverage.

This tier includes full enforcement stacks, cross-layer verification, multi-actor accountability binding, jurisdiction-aware audit mapping, and resilience against sophisticated adversarial manipulation.

Ultra-tier governance is intended for AGI-class systems, critical infrastructure, courts, national financial systems, and cross-border deployments.

Guarantees at this tier ensure continuous lawful operation, provable accountability, and enforceable human authority at all times.

⸻

**7. POST-QUANTUM EXTENSION — CRYPTOGRAPHIC RESILIENCE**

The Post-Quantum extension adds cryptographic resilience against quantum and post-quantum attack vectors.

This extension applies across Supreme and Ultra tiers and includes post-quantum receipts, key rotation policies, attack detection, and forward-secure audit continuity.

This extension is mandatory for long-lived systems, sovereign records, defence-related deployments, and systems requiring decades-long verifiability.

Guarantees at this level ensure governance integrity remains verifiable even under future cryptographic disruption.

⸻

**8. TIER-TO-SYSTEM BINDING RULE**

Governance guarantees apply only when a licensed service tier is bound to a declared system class.

AI systems may operate under any tier depending on risk.
AGI systems require Supreme or Ultra tiers by definition.
Robotic systems require Supreme or Ultra tiers depending on autonomy and physical risk.

No service tier may be used to imply coverage of a system class it is not licensed for.

⸻

**9. FINAL CLARIFICATION OF GUARANTEES**

TruthSeal™ guarantees governance, not intelligence quality.
TruthSeal™ guarantees accountability, not outcome desirability.
TruthSeal™ guarantees enforcement capability, not human decision correctness.

What TruthSeal™ provides is the infrastructure that makes AI, AGI, and robotic systems lawful, auditable, controllable, and accountable under human authority.

⸻

FINAL AUTHORITY

This document is the authoritative public reference for interpreting TruthSeal™ governance guarantees across service tiers and system classes. Any contradiction with marketing material or informal explanations must defer to this document.
