## 1. SYSTEM CLASS SCOPE (WHAT IS GOVERNED)

This system class applies to robotic and cyber-physical systems that execute physical actions in the real world under algorithmic, AI, or AGI control.

Systems governed under this class convert digital decisions into mechanical, electrical, kinetic, environmental, or spatial effects.

This includes stationary robotics, mobile robots, autonomous vehicles, drones, industrial automation, medical devices, logistics systems, and robotic swarms.

The class applies regardless of autonomy level, embodiment, or deployment environment.

Robotic systems governed under this class may operate continuously, semi-autonomously, or autonomously with human oversight.

Any system capable of causing physical harm, property damage, environmental impact, or infrastructure disruption falls under this class.

This scope includes systems embedded in larger platforms if they retain execution authority.

Purely simulated or advisory systems are excluded.

---

## 2. GOVERNANCE OBJECTIVE

The objective of governance for robotic systems is to ensure lawful, bounded, and accountable physical execution.

Robotic systems introduce irreversible real-world consequences that cannot be undone once executed.

TruthSeal™ governance exists to prevent unaccountable actuation, unsafe autonomy, or authority ambiguity.

Governance ensures that every physical action is attributable to authorised human or institutional authority.

The objective is to enforce human supremacy over actuation, escalation, and mission authority.

Robotic governance focuses on execution control, not task optimisation.

Physical autonomy is treated as a regulated privilege, not a default capability.

---

## 3. ACTIVE GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS

For robotic systems, TruthSeal™ activates continuous execution governance.

Active systems include action pre-authorisation checks, runtime actuation monitoring, immutable execution logs, and authority binding.

Every physical action is recorded as a verifiable execution event.

Governance systems operate in real time alongside robotic control systems.

Decision-to-action pathways are monitored to prevent unauthorised execution.

Governance records are suitable for forensic analysis, insurance review, and legal proceedings.

---

## 4. ENFORCEMENT & CONTAINMENT MODEL

Robotic systems governed under this class are subject to enforceable containment controls.

TruthSeal™ governance enables pause, override, safe-stop, or shutdown mechanisms bound to authorised operators.

Escalation thresholds are defined based on risk, environment, and operational context.

Containment actions are logged, attributable, and irreversible once triggered.

No robotic system may bypass enforcement under this class.

This model ensures that physical execution never exceeds declared authority.

---

## 5. ACCOUNTABILITY & RELIANCE

Reliance on TruthSeal™ governance for robotic systems means reliance on enforceable accountability for physical actions.

All actuation events remain attributable to responsible human authorities or institutions.

TruthSeal™ ensures that liability cannot be displaced onto machines.

Governance records provide continuous evidence of lawful operation.

TruthSeal™ does not assume responsibility for mission outcomes or operational strategy.

Reliance is limited to governance enforcement and accountability assurance.

This enables lawful deployment of robotics in high-risk environments.

---

## 6. EXCLUSIONS & NON-GUARANTEES

TruthSeal™ does not guarantee safety, performance, or correctness of robotic behaviour.

TruthSeal™ does not replace safety engineering, certification, or operational procedures.

TruthSeal™ does not eliminate human responsibility for deployment decisions.

Robotic systems operating outside declared scope are not covered.

Misclassification voids governance reliance.
