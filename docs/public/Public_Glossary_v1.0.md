## Purpose of This Glossary

This glossary provides **clear, first-time-reader definitions** of key TruthSeal™ concepts.

It exists to:
- establish shared language,
- prevent misinterpretation,
- and enable technical, institutional, and academic discourse.

No term in this document describes *how* enforcement occurs.

## Core Terms

### Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
A form of intelligence capable of learning, reasoning, and adapting across domains without task-specific reprogramming, while remaining accountable to human agency.

---

### Sovereign Arc of AGI
The conceptual trajectory through which intelligence evolves toward AGI under irreversible ethical and behavioural constraints, rather than unconstrained optimization.

---

### LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility)
A governing invariant stating that once a coherent, safe, and accountable behavioural path is established, regression to a weaker or more harmful state is not permitted.

---

### Cathedral
The conceptual architecture that frames AGI evolution under LEI = 1, defining non-negotiable foundations for coherence, accountability, and ethical stability.

---

### Behavioural Coherence
The property of an intelligent system whose actions, reasoning, and learning remain internally consistent over time and aligned with declared purpose.

---

### Accountability
The requirement that intelligent systems remain traceable, explainable, and answerable to human oversight and institutional governance.

---

### Temporal Consistency
The expectation that an intelligent system does not contradict itself across time when operating under the same principles and constraints.

---

### Governance Invariant
A rule or principle that applies globally and cannot be overridden by scale, capability, or context.

---

### Conceptual vs Operational Knowledge
Conceptual knowledge defines *what* a system is and *why* it exists.  
Operational knowledge defines *how* it enforces behaviour.  
This glossary contains **conceptual knowledge only**.

---

## Scope Limitation

This glossary does NOT define:
- enforcement systems,
- guardians or veto logic,
- audit mechanisms,
- custody or halt paths,
- internal scoring algorithms,
- or classified TruthSeal™ components.

All such systems exist under Doctorantura custody and are intentionally excluded.
