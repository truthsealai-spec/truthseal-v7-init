## 1. SYSTEM CLASS SCOPE (WHAT IS GOVERNED)

This system class applies to Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), autonomous, and cyber-physical systems deployed in defence, military, intelligence, space, and national-security environments.

Systems governed under this class may influence or execute actions with strategic, lethal, geopolitical, or existential consequences.

This includes command-and-control systems, intelligence analysis platforms, targeting systems, autonomous vehicles, space-based systems, and decision-support systems used in defence operations.

The class applies regardless of autonomy level, deployment domain, or technological embodiment.

Systems operating under sovereign authority or national mandate fall within this scope.

Any system whose failure, misuse, or manipulation could result in loss of life, armed conflict escalation, or irreversible national harm is included.

This scope applies across terrestrial, maritime, aerial, orbital, and cyber domains.

## 2. GOVERNANCE OBJECTIVE

The objective of governance for TS-DEF systems is to enforce absolute accountability, lawful authority, and controlled execution under human command.

Defence and military systems operate where mistakes are irreversible and consequences propagate beyond institutional boundaries.

TruthSeal™ governance exists to ensure that authority, responsibility, and liability remain explicitly bound to human decision-makers.

The objective is not optimisation of combat or strategy, but enforcement of lawful command structure.

Governance ensures that autonomous or semi-autonomous systems never exceed authorised mandate.

All execution must remain subordinate to human supremacy and legal authority.

Governance exists to prevent deniability, delegation drift, or machine-displaced responsibility.

---

## 3. ACTIVE GOVERNANCE SYSTEMS

TS-DEF systems activate the highest level of TruthSeal™ governance.

Active systems include continuous authority verification, pre-action legitimacy enforcement, immutable decision and execution records, and hardened audit continuity.

All decisions and actions are recorded with sovereign-grade traceability.

Governance operates continuously across mission lifecycle, not episodically.

Systems are monitored for behavioural deviation, mandate drift, or unauthorised escalation.

Governance records are designed for post-event review by courts, inquiries, and international bodies.

---

## 4. ENFORCEMENT & ESCALATION MODEL

Defence systems governed under this class are subject to real-time enforcement and escalation controls.

TruthSeal™ enables enforced pause, override, containment, or termination under authorised command.

Escalation thresholds are explicit, pre-declared, and legally bound.

No autonomous system may execute irreversible actions without validated authority.

Containment mechanisms are hardened and cannot be bypassed by software autonomy.

All enforcement actions are logged and attributable.

---

## 5. ACCOUNTABILITY & RELIANCE

Reliance on TruthSeal™ governance for TS-DEF systems means reliance on enforceable accountability, not operational infallibility.

Responsibility for actions remains with sovereign authorities and designated commanders.

TruthSeal™ ensures that accountability cannot be displaced onto machines or algorithms.

Governance records provide continuous evidence of lawful authority and command responsibility.

TruthSeal™ does not assume responsibility for strategic outcomes, military decisions, or mission success.

Reliance is strictly limited to governance enforcement and accountability assurance.

---

## 6. EXCLUSIONS & NON-GUARANTEES

TruthSeal™ does not guarantee mission success, tactical effectiveness, or operational safety.

TruthSeal™ does not replace military doctrine, rules of engagement, or sovereign legal frameworks.

TruthSeal™ does not design, deploy, or operate defence systems.

Systems operating outside declared authority or scope are not covered.

Misclassification or undeclared use voids reliance.
