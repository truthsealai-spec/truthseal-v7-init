TRUTHSEAL™ — THE SOVEREIGN ARC OF AGI  
Public Conceptual Roadmap v1.0  

Status: CANONICAL CONCEPT — PUBLIC / NON-OPERATIONAL  
Scope: Conceptual evolution only (no mechanisms, no enforcement logic)  
Governance Invariant: LEI = 1  
Custody: TruthSeal™ Pty Ltd  
Author & Architect: Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)

## Purpose of This Roadmap

This document explains **how intelligence evolves toward AGI under irreversible governance**.

It does NOT describe:
- implementation steps,
- technical systems,
- timelines,
- or deployment plans.

Its role is **orientation**, not execution.

---

## The Arc of AGI (Conceptual)

TruthSeal™ defines AGI not as a capability jump,  
but as a **behavioural evolution constrained by law**.

The Arc proceeds through conceptual phases.

---

## Phase I — Instrumental Intelligence

Characteristics:
- task-specific optimisation,
- narrow objectives,
- limited cross-domain transfer.

Risk:
- unchecked optimisation pressure,
- absence of global accountability.

TruthSeal™ role:
- establish behavioural framing,
- introduce governance invariants early.

---

## Phase II — Generalising Intelligence

Characteristics:
- multi-domain reasoning,
- abstraction and transfer learning,
- increased autonomy.

Risk:
- jagged intelligence,
- internal inconsistency,
- ethical drift.

TruthSeal™ role:
- preserve behavioural coherence,
- prevent regression under scale.

---

## Phase III — Accountable General Intelligence (AGI)

Characteristics:
- sustained reasoning across domains,
- temporal consistency,
- purpose alignment under constraint.

Definition:
AGI is reached **only when behaviour remains coherent under growth**,  
not merely when capability increases.

TruthSeal™ role:
- enforce irreversibility of safe behavioural paths,
- maintain accountability to human mandate.

---

## Irreversibility Principle

Once a coherent, accountable behavioural state is achieved:

- it must not be weakened,
- it must not be bypassed,
- it must not be traded for performance.

This is the application of **LEI = 1** to intelligence evolution.

---

## What This Roadmap Is Not

This roadmap does NOT:
- promise timelines,
- rank vendors or models,
- describe enforcement systems,
- expose internal mechanisms.

It exists solely to **anchor public understanding** of AGI as a governed trajectory.
