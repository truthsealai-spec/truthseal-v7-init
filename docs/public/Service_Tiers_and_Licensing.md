## 1. PURPOSE OF SERVICE TIERS

TruthSeal™ service tiers exist to provide clear, lawful, and auditable governance coverage for Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and autonomous robotic systems operating in real-world environments.

Not all intelligence systems carry the same level of risk, consequence, or dependency. A research model, an enterprise decision engine, a judicial analytics system, and an autonomous robotic platform each require fundamentally different levels of governance, accountability, and enforcement depth.

Service tiers allow institutions, governments, and enterprises to select governance coverage proportional to the operational impact of the systems they deploy or rely upon. The tier selected defines what governance systems are active, what audit depth applies, what enforcement mechanisms are enabled, and what level of human accountability is required.

TruthSeal™ does not sell software features. It licenses governance capability, legal assurance, and continuous oversight for AI, AGI, and robotic systems created and operated by others.

Service tiers are legally meaningful selections. They define obligations, protections, and enforceable guarantees for all parties involved.

## 2. BASE TIER — FOUNDATIONAL AI GOVERNANCE

The Base Tier applies to Artificial Intelligence systems that perform bounded, non-general cognitive functions and operate in advisory, analytical, or decision-support roles.

Typical systems include forecasting models, recommendation engines, optimisation systems, scoring algorithms, and automated analysis tools that influence decisions without executing autonomous control.

This tier provides foundational governance coverage, including output coherence verification, audit traceability, decision provenance recording, and basic accountability mapping to responsible human operators.

The Base Tier is designed for environments where AI outputs inform decisions but do not independently trigger irreversible actions or physical execution.

It is commonly used by universities, research institutions, early-stage enterprises, internal analytics teams, and low-risk commercial applications.

This tier establishes trust in AI outputs without imposing heavyweight enforcement or escalation mechanisms.

## 3. STANDARD TIER — ENTERPRISE & REGULATED AI SYSTEMS

The Standard Tier applies to AI systems deployed in regulated, commercial, or institutional environments where decisions materially affect financial, legal, operational, or societal outcomes.

Systems under this tier may drive pricing, credit assessment, risk evaluation, operational planning, compliance monitoring, or automated business processes.

In addition to foundational governance, this tier activates continuous audit readiness, integrity monitoring, decision receipt generation, and escalation visibility for authorised human oversight.

The Standard Tier is suitable for banks, insurers, enterprises, utilities, healthcare administrators, and regulated service providers that rely on AI outputs at scale.

This tier ensures that AI-driven decisions remain provable, reviewable, and defensible under regulatory or legal scrutiny.

It is the most common tier for production AI systems with sustained real-world impact.

## 4. SUPREME TIER — AGI, ROBOTICS & HIGH-IMPACT SYSTEMS

The Supreme Tier applies to Artificial General Intelligence systems and autonomous robotic systems capable of multi-domain reasoning, adaptive goal formation, or physical execution in the real world.

These systems may operate continuously, reconcile competing objectives, or directly influence physical environments, infrastructure, or human safety.

This tier enables full governance coverage, including pre-action legitimacy enforcement, human override capability, escalation controls, irreversible action gating, and continuous integrity surveillance.

The Supreme Tier is intended for advanced AI deployments, robotics platforms, industrial automation, large-scale decision engines, and systems whose failure or misuse could cause serious harm.

It provides the highest level of assurance available to non-sovereign users.

This tier is commonly selected by major enterprises, infrastructure operators, advanced robotics developers, and high-liability institutions.

---

## 5. ULTRA / SOVEREIGN TIER — DEFENCE, MILITARY & SPACE

The Ultra / Sovereign Tier applies to AI, AGI, and autonomous systems operating in defence, military, intelligence, aerospace, and sovereign-critical environments.

These systems may influence national security, strategic decision-making, weapons platforms, space operations, or other domains where consequences are existential or irreversible.

This tier activates the full TruthSeal™ governance stack, including sovereign-level audit depth, hardened enforcement pathways, continuous accountability binding, and advanced resilience against post-quantum and quantum-era threats.

Ultra Tier licensing is limited, deliberate, and subject to heightened contractual, legal, and operational controls.

It is designed for governments, defence contractors, space agencies, and sovereign institutions requiring the strongest possible assurance that intelligent systems remain lawful, controllable, and accountable.

This tier represents the maximum governance capability TruthSeal™ provides.

---

## 6. LICENSING SCOPE & EXCLUSIONS

TruthSeal™ licenses governance systems, audit systems, enforcement systems, and accountability systems — not AI models, datasets, or intelligence outputs.

TruthSeal™ does not develop AI, AGI, or robotic systems and does not participate in model training, deployment, or operation.

Licensing grants the right to apply TruthSeal™ governance layers to external systems owned or operated by the licensee.

Each tier explicitly defines which governance mechanisms are active and which are excluded. Using a lower tier for higher-risk systems constitutes misuse.

Licensing is contractual, auditable, and enforceable.

---

## 7. TYPICAL USERS BY TIER

Base Tier users include universities, research labs, internal analytics teams, and low-risk commercial applications.

Standard Tier users include banks, insurers, enterprises, utilities, healthcare administrators, and regulated service providers.

Supreme Tier users include advanced AI developers, robotics companies, infrastructure operators, and high-liability institutions.

Ultra / Sovereign Tier users include governments, defence organisations, military contractors, and space agencies.

Selecting the correct tier protects both the user and the public.
