**TS-INFRA — CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM CLASS**

────────────────────────────────────────
**1. SYSTEM CLASS DEFINITION (WHAT IS GOVERNED)**

The TS-INFRA System Class governs Artificial Intelligence (AI), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), automated control, and decision systems that manage, influence, or constrain critical infrastructure operations.

Critical infrastructure systems are those whose failure, misuse, or manipulation may cause large-scale societal disruption, economic harm, loss of essential services, environmental damage, or cascading national consequences.

This includes infrastructure related to energy, water, transport, communications, finance, healthcare, emergency response, and essential public services.

────────────────────────────────────────
**2. GOVERNANCE THRESHOLD**

Critical infrastructure systems operate above acceptable failure tolerance.

Any system whose outputs, decisions, or automated actions may disrupt essential services or public safety must operate under continuous TruthSeal™ governance.

TS-INFRA governance is mandatory where system behaviour:
• affects population-scale services,
• controls physical or digital infrastructure,
• interfaces with public safety systems,
• operates across jurisdictions or national boundaries.

────────────────────────────────────────
**3. TRUTHSEAL™ GOVERNANCE GUARANTEES**

TruthSeal™ governance under TS-INFRA ensures that:

• All operational decisions are attributable to accountable human authority
• Control actions and system outputs are continuously auditable
• Safety, continuity, and legal constraints are enforceable
• Faults, anomalies, misuse, or interference are detectable and provable
• Emergency intervention and human override remain available
• Infrastructure authority cannot be delegated to machines

System resilience is governed; responsibility remains human.

────────────────────────────────────────
**4. MANDATORY SERVICE TIER ALIGNMENT**

TS-INFRA systems require elevated governance depth:

• Standard tier applies only to non-safety-critical analytical support
• Supreme tier is mandatory for live operational control
• Ultra tier is mandatory for national-scale, cross-border, or sovereign infrastructure

Service tier selection determines enforcement depth, audit continuity, and liability binding.

────────────────────────────────────────
**5. INTERACTION WITH AI, AGI, AND ROBOTIC SYSTEMS**

Where infrastructure systems rely on AI, AGI, or robotic execution:

• TS-INFRA must be paired with TS-AI, TS-AGI, and/or TS-R system classes
• Accountability chains must span intelligence, control, and execution layers
• No separation between decision authority and infrastructure impact is permitted

────────────────────────────────────────
**6. REGULATORY AND INSTITUTIONAL RELIANCE**

TS-INFRA governance enables lawful reliance by:
• national infrastructure regulators,
• safety and emergency authorities,
• courts and insurers,
• sovereign operators and governments,
• cross-border oversight bodies.

Reliance is based on provable accountability and enforceable governance, not system perfection.

────────────────────────────────────────
**7. NON-DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY**

Under TS-INFRA governance:
• Infrastructure systems are not legal actors
• Infrastructure control cannot assume liability
• Automation cannot replace human authority

Liability follows command, ownership, and jurisdiction.

────────────────────────────────────────
**8. SCOPE LIMITATION**

No governance, audit, enforcement, or accountability guarantee exists for:
• undeclared infrastructure components,
• experimental or offline systems,
• actions outside licensed service tiers,
• effects beyond declared operational scope.
