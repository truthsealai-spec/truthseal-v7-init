TRUTHSEAL™ — CANONICAL PUBLIC DEFINITION  
Status: Canon v1.0  
Scope: Public / Non-classified

## 1. Definition

TruthSeal™ is a sovereign governance system for the behaviour and evolution of artificial intelligence.

It establishes irreversible coherence constraints that intelligence systems must satisfy in order to operate, scale, and evolve safely over time.

TruthSeal™ does not assess isolated outputs.  
It governs **behaviour, continuity, and legitimacy across time**.

---

## 2. Core Principle — Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1)

TruthSeal™ is founded on the Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1):

Once an intelligence system demonstrates a coherent, non-harmful operational state, it must not regress into a less coherent or higher-risk state as it evolves.

Regression is treated as a violation of system legitimacy, not as an optimisation trade-off.

## 3. The Sovereign Arc of AGI

The Sovereign Arc of AGI defines the structured pathway through which increasingly general intelligence may emerge while remaining:

- temporally consistent,
- behaviourally accountable,
- auditable across decision epochs,
- and constrained by irreversible laws.

AGI is not treated as a sudden capability jump, but as a **governed evolutionary process**.

## 4. What TruthSeal™ Provides

TruthSeal™ provides:

- Behavioural governance rather than content moderation  
- Temporal coherence guarantees rather than point-in-time validation  
- Cryptographic and procedural legitimacy rather than subjective judgment  
- Preventive coherence enforcement rather than post-incident analysis  

These guarantees apply across development, deployment, and long-term evolution.

---

## 5. Institutional Role

TruthSeal™ functions as a legitimacy and governance layer for intelligence itself.

It enables institutions, developers, and societies to rely on AI systems whose behaviour and evolution are constrained by transparent, auditable, and non-regressive rules.

This scaffold is canonical for public-facing documentation and technical orientation.
