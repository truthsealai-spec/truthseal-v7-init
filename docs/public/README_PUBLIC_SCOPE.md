# TruthSeal™ — Public Scope Notice

This repository contains **public-facing conceptual materials only**.

TruthSeal™ public documents:
- explain principles,
- describe intent,
- establish philosophical and institutional framing.

They do NOT expose:
- enforcement logic,
- veto paths,
- internal guardians,
- custody, halt, or audit mechanics.

All operational, behavioural, and enforcement systems
exist exclusively under Doctorantura custody.

If a document describes **how behaviour is enforced**,
it does not belong in this scope.
