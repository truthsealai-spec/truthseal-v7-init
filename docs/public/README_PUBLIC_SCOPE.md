## 1. Purpose of This File

This file defines the **absolute boundary of public-facing materials** within the TruthSeal™ repository.

It exists to ensure:
- clarity for external readers,
- protection of sovereign and internal mechanisms,
- zero accidental disclosure of enforcement logic, custody systems, or operational law.

No public document may exceed or contradict this scope.

## 2. What “Public” Means in TruthSeal™

Public documents are:

- explanatory,  
- conceptual,  
- descriptive,  
- non-operational,  
- non-enforcing,  
- non-authoritative.

They **do not**:
- define law,
- mandate adoption,
- confer exclusivity,
- expose enforcement mechanisms,
- describe internal governance execution,
- disclose custody or control systems.

All legal, ethical, and constitutional authority remains exclusively with the **TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc**.
