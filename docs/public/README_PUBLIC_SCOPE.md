## 1. Purpose of This File

This file defines the **absolute boundary of public-facing materials** within the TruthSeal™ repository.

It exists to ensure:
- clarity for external readers,
- protection of sovereign and internal mechanisms,
- zero accidental disclosure of enforcement logic, custody systems, or operational law.

No public document may exceed or contradict this scope.

---

## 2. What “Public” Means in TruthSeal™

Public documents are:

- explanatory,  
- conceptual,  
- descriptive,  
- non-operational,  
- non-enforcing,  
- non-authoritative.

They **do not**:
- define law,
- mandate adoption,
- confer exclusivity,
- expose enforcement mechanisms,
- describe internal governance execution,
- disclose custody or control systems.

All legal, ethical, and constitutional authority remains exclusively with the **TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc**.

---

## 3. Canonical Public Folder

The **only** public-facing materials in this repository live in:
docs/public/
Any document outside this folder is **not public**, regardless of naming or content.

---

## 4. Approved Public Documents

The following documents are approved for public viewing:

- `README_PUBLIC_SCOPE.md` (this file)
- `Hardware_Governance_Interface_Public_Concept_v1.0.md`
- `Public_FAQ_v1.0.md`
- `Public_Glossary_v1.0.md`
- `Public_Conceptual_Roadmap_v1.0.md`
- `Public_Exposure_Audit_v1.0.md`
- `Public_Positioning_What_TruthSeal_Is_Not_v1.0.md`
- `Cathedral_Public_Overview_v1.0.md`
- `Sovereign_Arc_Embodied_Intent_Public_v1.0.md`
- `Robotic_Identity_and_Lifecycle_Public_v1.0.md`

Any addition requires **explicit Sovereign Arc authorization**.

---

## 5. Explicit Exclusions (NOT Public)

The following are **never public**, even if referenced conceptually:

- enforcement logic,
- hardware gate schematics,
- custody systems,
- audit internals,
- cryptographic key flows,
- ledger write mechanics,
- validator logic,
- Doctorantura materials,
- partner-only packs,
- regulator-only briefings.

References may exist **only at a conceptual level**.

---

## 6. Relationship to Other Indexes

- `docs/README.md` → **Authoritative Documentation Index**
- `governance/partners/` → Partner / NDA-bound materials
- `governance/ledger/` → Canonical sovereign records
- `docs/internal/` → Internal-only (non-public)

This file does **not** override those indexes — it enforces the public boundary only.

---

## 7. Final Boundary Clause

If a document creates ambiguity about whether it is public,  
**it is not public** until explicitly designated as such.

TruthSeal™ operates under **irreversibility of responsibility**.  
Public clarity is mandatory. Leakage is not tolerated.
