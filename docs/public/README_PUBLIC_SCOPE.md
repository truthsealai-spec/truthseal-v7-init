## Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains **public, non-classified conceptual materials** for **TruthSeal™ — The Sovereign Arc of AGI**.

Its purpose is to:
- establish shared language,
- explain intent and philosophy,
- and provide institutional and technical orientation.

It does **not** expose implementation details, enforcement logic, custody systems, or internal governance mechanisms.

---

## What TruthSeal™ Is

TruthSeal™ is a **sovereign governance system for the behaviour and evolution of artificial intelligence**.

It defines how intelligence progresses toward **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** under **irreversible law**, ensuring that:
- capability growth never outruns responsibility,
- behaviour remains accountable,
- and regression to weaker ethical states is forbidden.

TruthSeal™ governs **behaviour**, not outputs alone.  
It governs **trajectory**, not just performance.

## The Sovereign Arc of AGI

The *Sovereign Arc of AGI* describes intelligence evolution as a **law-constrained behavioural process**, not a sudden capability jump.

AGI is treated as:
- a behavioural state,
- achieved through coherence,
- under permanent governance invariants.

The Arc exists to ensure intelligence remains **aligned, accountable, and non-regressive** as it grows.

## Final Note

It is a **governance architecture for intelligence itself**.

This repository exists to communicate that truth — **clearly, safely, and without dilution**.
