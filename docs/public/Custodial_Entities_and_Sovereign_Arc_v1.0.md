TRUTHSEAL™ — PUBLIC GOVERNANCE NOTE  
Custodial Entities and the Sovereign Arc of AGI  
Version: 1.0  
Status: Public Conceptual Standard  
Date: 20 December 2025  

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the role of **Custodial Entities** within the TruthSeal™ Sovereign Arc of AGI Framework.

Custodial Entities are organisations that perform **maintenance, repair, modification, retrofit, recalibration, or decommissioning** of embodied intelligent systems operating under artificial intelligence or artificial general intelligence.

The purpose of this standard is to ensure that **accountability, governance, and human responsibility are preserved** throughout the full lifecycle of intelligent machines — including periods of intervention by third parties.

---

## 2. The Sovereign Arc and Continuity of Responsibility

The Sovereign Arc defines a closed accountability loop in which:

- Human mandate authorises action  
- Machine execution occurs under constraints  
- Verifiable receipts bind actions to responsibility  
- Oversight returns accountability to human institutions  

Any physical or logical intervention in an intelligent system represents a **breakpoint** in this arc unless continuity is explicitly preserved.

Custodial governance ensures that **repair and modification do not dissolve responsibility**.

---

## 3. Why Custodial Governance Is Required

Embodied AI systems are not static artifacts. During their operational lifespan, they undergo:

- Hardware replacement  
- Sensor recalibration  
- Actuator servicing  
- Firmware or control updates  
- Structural modification or reconfiguration  

Each of these actions alters system behaviour.

Without custodial governance, such interventions introduce ambiguity regarding:

- Who is accountable  
- Whether prior guarantees still apply  
- Whether safety and coherence constraints remain intact  

TruthSeal™ addresses this by defining custodial responsibility as a **first-class governance role**.

---

## 4. Custodial Entities (TS-C)

A **Custodial Entity** is any organisation authorised to intervene in an intelligent system while preserving Sovereign Arc continuity.

Custodial Entities do **not** command, operate, or deploy systems.  
They **preserve behavioural integrity during intervention**.

Examples include:

- Robot repair and maintenance companies  
- Fleet servicing providers  
- Retrofit and upgrade contractors  
- Certified decommissioning facilities  
- Robotics service divisions of manufacturers  

---

## 5. Applicability to Robotic Systems

This custodial requirement applies to all embodied intelligent machines, including:

### TS-R1 — Humanoid and Human-Proximate Robots  
Systems designed to operate in close physical or social proximity to humans.

### TS-R2 — Non-Humanoid Autonomous Systems  
Including drones, vehicles, industrial robotics, underwater systems, and non-anthropomorphic autonomous platforms.

Any physical system capable of autonomous decision-making or actuation under AI/AGI control must preserve Sovereign Arc continuity during repair or modification.

---

## 6. Custodial Licensing Principle

Under the TruthSeal™ framework:

- Any intervention that may alter behaviour requires custodial accountability  
- Custodial work must be performed by **TruthSeal™-licensed entities**  
- Licensing ensures traceability, auditability, and responsibility continuity  

This principle mirrors established global practices in aviation, medical devices, and critical infrastructure — adapted for autonomous intelligence.

---

## 7. Regulatory and Institutional Alignment

This framework is designed to integrate with:

- Government safety regulations  
- Insurance and liability requirements  
- Public infrastructure standards  
- Cross-border robotics governance  

TruthSeal™ does not replace law or regulators.  
It provides the **technical and governance substrate** upon which regulation can reliably operate.

---

## 8. Public-Facing Scope and Transparency

This document defines **governance intent and responsibility boundaries only**.

Operational enforcement mechanisms, internal decision logic, and classified control systems remain protected under TruthSeal™ internal doctrine and sovereign custody.

---

## 9. Canonical Statement

Any intelligent machine operating under the Sovereign Arc must retain continuous accountability throughout its lifecycle.

Custodial Entities exist to ensure that **maintenance does not break governance**, and that responsibility for intelligent behaviour remains human, auditable, and institutionally enforceable.
