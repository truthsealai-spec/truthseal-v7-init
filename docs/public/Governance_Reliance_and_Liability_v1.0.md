Public Canonical Document

date: 2025-12-25  
version: 1.0

---

## 1. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document defines the legal meaning, reliance scope, and liability boundaries associated with TruthSeal™ governance services.

It establishes how TruthSeal™ outputs, certifications, dashboards, and audit artefacts may be relied upon by governments, courts, enterprises, insurers, and institutional users.

This document exists to remove ambiguity regarding responsibility, authority, and legal interpretation.

It applies across all TruthSeal™ service tiers and system classes.

This document is binding for licensing interpretation, contractual reliance, and enforcement scope.

---

## 2. NATURE OF RELIANCE

TruthSeal™ provides governance, audit, enforcement, and accountability infrastructure.

TruthSeal™ does not provide predictions, outcomes, decisions, operational control, or guarantees of system performance.

Reliance on TruthSeal™ is limited to the verification of governance status, compliance posture, accountability mapping, and audit continuity.

TruthSeal™ outputs are evidentiary and interpretive, not directive.

Reliance applies to governance facts, not to the behaviour or results of governed systems.

---

## 3. NO OUTCOME GUARANTEES

TruthSeal™ makes no guarantees regarding safety, correctness, effectiveness, profitability, legality, or success of any AI, AGI, robotic, or defence system.

Certification under TruthSeal™ does not imply that a system is error-free, harmless, optimal, or fit for any particular purpose.

TruthSeal™ does not warrant future behaviour of any governed system.

All operational, ethical, legal, and strategic decisions remain the responsibility of system owners and operators.

---

## 4. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

TruthSeal™ is not liable for damages arising from the operation, misuse, failure, or unintended behaviour of external systems.

Liability for system outcomes rests solely with the entity that designs, deploys, operates, or authorises the system.

TruthSeal™ liability is limited to the accurate provision of governance records, audit artefacts, and enforcement actions explicitly defined under the licensed tier.

No liability extends beyond the activated governance scope.

---

## 5. RELIANCE BY THIRD PARTIES

Courts, regulators, insurers, and institutions may rely on TruthSeal™ artefacts as evidence of governance state at a given time.

Such reliance does not transfer operational responsibility to TruthSeal™.

TruthSeal™ artefacts may support legal, regulatory, or contractual assessment but do not substitute independent judgment.

Third-party reliance is limited to documented, verifiable outputs.

---

## 6. MISUSE AND MISREPRESENTATION

Use of TruthSeal™ branding, certification, or artefacts outside the licensed scope constitutes misrepresentation.

Misclassification of systems or concealment of system capabilities voids reliance and protections.

TruthSeal™ reserves the right to revoke certification and public status in cases of misuse.

---

## 7. FINAL INTERPRETATION

This document governs the interpretation of all TruthSeal™ public and contractual materials.

In the event of conflict, this document prevails.

No implied guarantees, assurances, or warranties exist beyond what is explicitly stated.
