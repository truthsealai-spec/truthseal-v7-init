  objective: >
    Establish the TruthSeal TCS-1 (Time Crystal Standard) to define measurable criteria
    for quantum coherence persistence, energy symmetry stability, and ethical audit verifiability
    in Time Crystal-based sensing and computation systems.

  parameters:
    - coherence_stability: "≥10^6 oscillation cycles under sub-decoherence threshold"
    - temporal_symmetry_variance: "<0.01 per microperiod"
    - ethical_audit_window: "Δt ≤ 1e−9 s (TruthSeal Coherence Law)"
    - QENC_link: "QENC_v1_0_ProofCapsule.yaml"
    - ULIP_binding: "UQE-FIC_v1_0"

  compliance:
    - Sovereign Law: "LEI = 1 (Law of Ethical Irreversibility)"
    - Validation Ledger: "VLS_QIC1_v1_0"
    - Audit Entity: "DEVORA v0.1.1 — Reflection Auditor"

  verification_status: "Active — Ready for Timestamp Anchoring"
  next_phase: "Integrate with QENC Failover Capsule"
