    capacity_constraints: "OFF (v1); ON in v1.1"
    time_windows: "OFF (v1)"

  method:
    mapping: "VRP → TSP reduction → QUBO; penalty weights λ_route, λ_degree"
    hamiltonians:

    optimizer: "COBYLA / SPSA"
    backend:
      gate_model: "50-qubit simulator (Aer or equivalent)"
      note: "If annealer used, run QUBO on annealer as baseline; treat as separate track."

  validation:
    reproducibility: "Fix seeds; log β,γ; store result JSON"
    ledger: "Commit JSON + SHA256 to VLS; add CID later"
    unknowns: ["Quantum advantage at n=15 is UNKNOWN; report honestly."]

  risks:
    - "QAOA sensitivity to penalty tuning λ_*"
    - "Barren plateaus at higher p"
