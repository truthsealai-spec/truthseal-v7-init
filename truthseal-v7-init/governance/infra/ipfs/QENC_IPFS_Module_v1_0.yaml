    Anchor TruthSeal artifacts via official IPFS tools with verifiable CIDs.
    No web forms. No payments. Full auditability.
  toolchain:
    ipfs_cli: ">=0.28 from ipfs.tech (official)"
    w3up_client: "OPTIONAL — Protocol Labs signed keys only"
  policy:
    - "Never submit card/PII to storage providers."
    - "Only use DNSSEC-verified domains (ipfs.tech, web3.storage docs)."
    - "All files hashed before add: sha256(recorded)."
  operation:
    - step_1_hash: "sha256 <file> → write into governance/ledger/seals/"
    - step_2_add:  "ipfs add --cid-version=1 <file> → produce CIDv1"
    - step_3_pin:  "ipfs pin add <CID>; keep local node online"
    - step_4_record: "append CID to IPFS_CID_Record_v1.yaml (path below)"
    - step_5_verify: "gateway fetch x2 (ipfs.io, dweb.link) → re-hash match"
    - step_6_optional_w3up: "w3up upload <file> → record DID space + CID"
  records:
    cid_registry_path: "governance/ledger/seals/IPFS_CID_Record_v1.yaml"
    sha_registry_path: "governance/ledger/seals/"
  failover:
    - "If gateways down → keep local, retry in 24h; no third-party sites."
