# TruthSeal™ AEGIS
Hardware-Enforced Governance for Critical AI Systems
Dr. Nickolay Traykov – November 20, 2025

No high-impact AI action may execute without proving coherence, irreversibility, and life-preservation — all in hardware below the OS.

Classical, buildable on 5 nm / 3 nm silicon. FPGA prototype 2026.

Specs, TDC definition, ACS formula, and roadmap coming in next commits.

Open proposal – regulator & industry feedback welcome.
