# Chapter <NN>: <Title> — TQC Dual-Lane Scaffold
version: 1.0
status: Draft | Review | Locked
owner: TruthSeal™ — Dr. Nickolay Traykov (Prof. h.c.)

## 1) Premise & Scope (2–4 lines)
<Concise institutional statement of the problem and intended outcome.>

## 2) Philosophical Lane — Doctrine & Governance
- Moral intent: <e.g., “Preserve safety while sustaining capability under the Law of Ethical Irreversibility (LEI = 1).”>
- Governance anchors: <list applicable laws/principles (e.g., LEI = 1; operational TLC threshold rule).>
- Morphological thinking (brief):
  - Dimensions: <D1, D2, D3, …>
  - States per dimension: <…>
  - Cross-consistency: <forbidden/required combos + justification>
- Public rule vs internal doctrine:
  - Public operational rule: <state clearly>
  - Internal Ω doctrine note: CLASSIFIED (if applicable)

## 3) Mathematical Lane — Definitions & Invariants
### 3.1 Symbols & Thresholds
<Define ACS, TCS, θ thresholds; any additional variables.>
### 3.2 Assumptions & Invariants
<Enumerate A1…; invariants I1… tied to gates and safety bands.>
### 3.3 Core Equations
<Eq.1 objective/constraint; Eq.2 gating/penalty; Eq.3 test statistic/estimator.>
### 3.4 Proof / Argument Sketch (≤10 lines)
<Short, checkable reasoning; list explicit falsifiers.>

## 4) Protocols — Tests, Data, Receipts
- Test vectors: <names + intent>
- Measurement windows & monotonic clock policy
- Pass/Fail thresholds
- Receipt plan (schema ts.receipt.v1):
  - anchor_fields: ots_calendar_id, ots_status, ots_tx, originstamp_id, btcstamp_tx, anchored_rfc3339
  - forensic_flags: <list>

## 5) Risks & Mitigations
<R1 → Mitigation; R2 → Mitigation>

## 6) Deliverables
- Narrative file(s):
- Math annex (tables/figures):
- Receipts & anchors:

## 7) Acronyms used in this chapter (expanded at first use)
<LEI = 1; TLC; ACS; TCS; …>
